         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Princeſſe <hi>Clorias</hi> thoughts now were reaſonably well ſetled, concerning the ſafety of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> in regard of the meſſengers relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo <hi>Roxana</hi> with more alacrity and cheerfulneſſe, ſummoned a a new <hi>Dedalus,</hi> to make an end of thoſe paſſages belonging to the Iſland of <hi>Crete;</hi> whereupon one day meeting in the ſame walke that had entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Princeſſe, upon her firſt arrivall in the Country, they both ſeated themſelves together under a tree, artificially made into an Arbour of pleaſure, that had its full proſpect toward the ſea; whilſt he gave her this further accompt:</p>
            <p>Madam ſaid he, as for the intereſts which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned unto you not many dayes ſince, you may be pleaſed to know, that as <hi>Evarchus</hi> our King in his Warres with the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:169951:4"/>muſt be forced upon all occaſions, to court any aſſiſtance whatſoever for his beſt advantage, ſo of the other ſide doe the <hi>Cretans</hi> reſolve to make uſe of their preſent power, to gaine benefits to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and party in any thing they can procure, either from their Prince or any other: to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, after the agreement that I told you of, which I made with the Natives of the Country, (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many of the moſt rigid ſort, would not at all come within any manner of communication, whereby to be ſubject to the <hi>Lydian</hi> power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto incouraged as 'tis ſuppoſed by a meſſenger from <hi>Delphos,</hi> that neither underſtands the Iſlands intereſt or the peoples good) they deſigned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to be ſent to <hi>Philadelphae,</hi> where the King then remained, to Treat upon ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they conceived moſt neceſſary for their commodity and ſecurity: Thus arriving at court, in a ſhort time they were not onely admitted to kiſſe the Kings hands, but withall permitted to preſent their Petitions and requeſts; for this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (and ſo I may well call it, ſince it produced but ſmall effects, to the advantage of any party) there was appointed a great Hall in the City of <hi>Philadelpha,</hi> into which place the meſſengers were brought with ſome State, as ſoone as the King was ſeated in his Throne, becauſe they ſhould not complaine of the want of any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that belonged to the ſolemne entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ambaſſadours of other Nations, to make them the willinger to comply towards the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance deſired: After they had beene in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner received, as alſo with good language from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169951:4"/>Kings own mouth cheriſhed, they preſented a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that contained theſe peremptory demands: Firſt they deſired to have, not onely the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their religion through the whole Iſland, notwithſtanding the <hi>Lydian</hi> lawes to the contrary according to the rights and cuſtomes of <hi>Delphos,</hi> but withall to enjoy the uſe of the beſt Temples, alone appropriated to themſelves, with all the rents and priviledges that of old at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto them: Secondly, they expected an abſolute conceſſion from his Majeſty, that no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours whatſoever of any forraigne Nation, ſhould be appointed over them in <hi>Creet</hi> or in any Fort or Iſland belonging to the ſame; beſides they refuſed to admit of thoſe of the very Country it ſelfe, unleſſe they were confirmed and approved of by the gentrall councell, which they had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to manage &amp; odered all their affairs both in peace and Warre: And laſtly they expected, (as the writing which they had delivered the King expreſt) an abſolute reſtoration of all thoſe lands to the true owners, that had beene taken from their poſſeſſion, by reaſon of any former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rebellion, and given to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> or <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> either by the old Queene of <hi>Lydia,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varchus</hi> father: The King, as I was informed after he had read theſe propoſitions, ſeemed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view of the aſſembly, extreamely troubled in his apprehenſions, as if he had been exceedingly deceived in his expectation, concerning the good nature and reality of our country-men: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, notwithſtanding he was by this meanes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inflamed in his thoughts, in regard of theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169951:5"/>proceedings; (not onely in ſome ſort diſdaining to be thus handled by his Subjects in his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but being alſo with ſome reaſon ſuſpicious of their intentions, as fearing that they aymed to become Maſters of the whole Iſland, and ſo by conſequence to be poſſeſſors of moſt of the Lands of his beſt friends, who were actually imployed now with him in his Warres) yet conceiving that he was not at the inſtant, in a capacity to ſhew much diſcontent to any party, that could either good or hurt him in his preſent differences with the Senate, he gave their commiſſioners at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faire words in the generall, promiſing ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſend particular meſſengers of his own into <hi>Creet,</hi> not onely more knowingly to Treat with them concerning their demands; but withall, if it were poſſible, to conclude with them concerning his own deſires, which he conceived would be for both their advantages, againſt the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that had an intention to deſtroy either: in this manner they were diſmiſt into their owne Country, partly pleaſed, and a great deale more unſatisfied, in regard no more life remained from their imployment, then the expectation of the comming of the Kings officers: But in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim whilſt theſe meſſengers were look't for, both the Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> and the Country of <hi>Aegypt</hi> put in for their ſeverall intereſts, as well concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the government it ſelfe of the Iſland, as to be ſupplyed from hence, with Souldiers in their Warres, one againſt another; the State of <hi>Syria</hi> went onely upon the ſcore of <hi>Evarchus</hi> right and Titles, though <hi>Soraſtros</hi> challenged their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169951:5"/>in his ſervice, by an ancient Tye as he ſaid they owed the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Nation: neither as I told you formerly, was the Arch-<hi>Flamin</hi> of <hi>Delphos</hi> backward in maintaining to the uttermoſt of his power (by the induſtry of ſome inſtruments he imployed) his owne juriſdiction above either; as pretending the beſt right to the ſame, by reaſon of thoſe agreements that had been made with the Kings of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who firſt conquered this Iſland.</p>
            <p>Theſe attempts I muſt ſay, extreamely divided the inhabitants both in their actions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for as the more moderate ſort of people (eſpecially thoſe that had any correſpondency with the <hi>Lydians,</hi> either by extraction or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce) were willing enough to continue the old government, and retaine both their lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes they had formerly uſed, ſo the violenter part of the Natives, that had time out of minde contracted a certaine kinde of barbariſme in their manners and diſpoſitions, would heare of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, but what was preſcribed them by a few commanders, that were ſent from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Warres, who ſeemed onely to comply with the religion of <hi>Delphos</hi> for their owne ends: The people I may affirme with ſome confidence, were ſo far tranſported, &amp; infatuated with this ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ambition (their governours in the interim, ſuppoſing they ſhould be made petty Princes in command, amongſt the more ignorant ſort of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) that they did not onely decline violently all manner of reaſonable accords, but even were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to hate with an exact ſpleene and malice, all their owne country men, friends and kindred,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169951:6"/>that had any manner of correſpondency, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the leaſt communication with thoſe of the <hi>Lydian</hi> race and intereſt: In the Interim the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> finding this violence and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt us, reſolved to put many of the ſtrong Forts of the Country (which from the beginning of the troubles, they had kept in their poſſeſſion) abſolutely into the hands of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to avoid the expence; and inconveniency of the Warre in their owne particulars, having as they thought enough to doe with their King in in <hi>Lydia;</hi> and the rather for that they knew, that as <hi>Myſſia</hi> was moſt proper, to ſend Souldiers of their owne Nation into the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to contend with the inhabitants, ſo was there ſuch an inveterate ſpleene and hatred between the Natives of both Countreys, not onely in regard of their poſſeſſions, but their religion, that no recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was at any time to be feared: beſides the <hi>Myſſians</hi> with others of <hi>Lydia</hi> of their faction and intereſts, ſuppoſed the old <hi>Cretans</hi> owed them a ſecret revenge, for having injuriouſly outed them of their lands and eſtates, in the time of the late King <hi>Evarchus</hi> father.</p>
            <p>Theſe Tranſactions I ſay, filled the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a new with bloud and ſlaughters; and the more confuſed it proved; (and ſo conſequently the more horrid) in regard that for the moſt part, we fought dividedly upon the generall ſcore of three intereſts: ſometimes two againſt one, &amp; then againe each for it ſelfe, as often as any oppoſition was found, which not ſeldome hapned, in regard of the many jealouſies and ſuſpitions, riſing daily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169951:6"/>out of the variety of apprehenſions by reaſon of frequent accidents: ſo that in a ſhort time, almoſt in every place the Townes were fired, the people deſtroyed, and the countrey depopulated; being no ſafety in any place, or ſcarce the leaſt meanes of ſubſiſtance out of Armies, unleſſe it were under the walls, and protection of ſome few garriſons, that ſecured a kind of ſmall circuit, for neceſſary proviſions, to maintain themſelves and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of their juriſdiction: but the King at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from me and others intelligence of theſe lamentable proceedings, in the Iſland of <hi>Creet</hi> (as truly in a manner it was paſt all examples, ſince the intention of all ſides, was not alone to contend about diſputable rights, occaſioned by ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer oppreſſion, but even to extirpate not onely whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it ſelfe, that ſhould have the unhappineſſe to be overcome by the other) gave order to me if it were poſſible to reconcile theſe bloudy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and horrid contentions, with all the ſpeed I could, eſpecially amongſt thoſe of his own party, neither was he determintd to exclude out of this number the old <hi>Cretans</hi> themſelves, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon other intereſts, onely in regard they ſeemed by their declarations formerly in words to ſtand for his Title and authority, againſt the proceedings of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> though publickly, they contended violently with his Forces in the field: 'Tis true I cannot deny but in ſome things they had reaſon enough for their jealouſies, the King very often being conſtrained, to goe even from his own reſolutions, to give ſatisfaction to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169951:7"/>thoſe Councels that were continually about his perſon; who perſwaded him, he loſt the love of his people in <hi>Lydia,</hi> by ſeeming in any kind to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or countenance the <hi>Cretans</hi> in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who as they pretended were enemies to their generall eſtabliſhed religion; Of the other ſide the Natives were againe by much too cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and miſtruſtfull not onely to deſire violently other mens poſſeſſions and eſtates from them, but ſo entirely to doubt the Kings performance of his promiſes, when as they knew he did but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for his better advantage, to contract private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them in moſt particulars, in ſuch matters as appertained to the Temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as I ſaid too generall a diſtaſt, to thoſe of his owne party, within the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia.</hi> But to be ſhort, it was not very long, before the King ſent a moſt intimate councellor of his owne into the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> as well to informe me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of his pleaſure by word of mouth, as alſo to joyne himſelfe with me and others in commiſſion for the better and ſpeedier effecting of his deſignes: preſently as ſoone as hee arrived, we ſent out our ſummons to the whole Countrey in the generall, either to meet themſelves, or to appoint Deputies for each diviſion in the Iſland, to attend the Kings orders and direction upon a certaine day at <hi>Pergame,</hi> not onely to heare what ſhould be propounded in their Princes behalfe, for their future peace and advantage, but alſo we our ſelves would be ready to heare what the people would demand, to their further ſatisfaction, whereby their enemies, the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169951:9"/>ſelfe, upon whoſe fidelity and power the Kings preſent affaires depended, were actually veſted in a great part of thoſe Titles and rents (in a manner beyond any remembrance) either by gift or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: who no doubt upon ſuch a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagable change, meerly out of ſpleene and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte, would have quickly turned their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and affections, to the countenancing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> proceedings, againſt <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> their Prince: In the next place whereas they demanded, that either no ſtrange governours ſhould be appointed over any part of the Iſland, but meerly Natives, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch as ſhould be approved by the generall councell inſtituted by themſelves, I pray conſider but with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which I know you doe, what an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary (and I may ſay) a moſt prepoſterous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, it would have brought upon the Kings deſignes, not onely by reaſon of thoſe contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions, it would have created in all mens minds concerning his actions and want of ſpirit, but alſo have given ſo generall a diſtaſt to all his Subjects of beſt quality in both Kingdomes, that the effects muſt needs have beene of a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence, when as the principall men of honour ſhould be abſolutely outed, both of their preſent command or future expectation, to give way to the advancement of ſuch people, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew well how to governe when they ſhould be imployed, or the King himſelfe could be at all certaine of their fidelitie, when they were in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; as well in regard of the fantaſticall inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their own natures and diſpoſitions; as alſo

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169951:14"/>and conduct, he had diſgracefully chaſed from the ſiege.</p>
            <p>However the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> when ſhee came to the aſſured knowledge of theſe unfortunate paſſages, by which her owne liberty ſeemed again to be circumſcribed, by a new though a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour juriſdiction, although ſhee could not be but ſufficiently ſenſible of the unhappineſſe of ſuch a ſubjection, yet ſhee reſolved to meet her captivity with ſuch a majeſty, as either would bring revenge upon her perſon, in regard of her Fathers contentions, or procure a reſpectfull compaſſion from her enemies, that might defend her Dignity from all oppreſſion: with theſe thoughts (as if ſhee had beene of a ſudden mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly cured of her diſtempers) ſhee called for her Clothes, whereby the better to put her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious determinations in execution, when any violence to that purpoſe ſhould be attempted: but <hi>Roxana</hi> upon the inſtant comming in to her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to anſwer to that reſolution of her minde, not onely gave her counſell to lye ſtill, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but alſo entered into more neceſſary diſcourſes with her, concerning what was to be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; although ſhee could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her perſon or quality by this accident: To this purpoſe ſhee uſed this language unto her as ſhee lay in her bed: Madam ſaid ſhee, put the worſt, which is to be made priſoners to this new power, that as you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169951:14"/>ſee, hath not onely driven out <hi>Dedalus</hi> from his command, but probably will now circumvent all our other deſignes, if they can finde the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: they muſt either carry you into <hi>Lydia,</hi> or ſend you home into <hi>Cyprus;</hi> if they conducted you into <hi>Lydia,</hi> they cannot certainly be ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as to debarre you from the ſweet ſociety of your moſt honoured and noble Father, in whoſe converſation you will not only be delighted; as it may be imagined with a moſt ſupreame felicity, but alſo you will have the commodity, to impart unto him your ſecret reſolution, concerning the intended marriage, between my Lord <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and your ſelfe, which perhaps is a conveniency you would be moſt unwilling to miſſe; and in ſome ſort requiſite before you abſolutely finiſh thoſe other ceremonies, which in effect as you know, muſt have beene performed either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or by Deputy, to render you fully ſatisfied in your thoughts; ſince as you may remember you made an open profeſſion to that purpoſe: beſides how doe you know, but that you may finde your Father in ſuch a proſperous condition, that by the abſolutely ſubjection of his enemies, your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Queen may againe be called home to her old honours and felicities in <hi>Lydia?</hi> which would be the convenieteſt and beſt Theatre, whereon to act the happy parts of your moſt glorious Nuptialls: of the contrary if they ſhould ſend you into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> certainly you ſhould be in the place according to your own wiſhes, ſince all this while you have endeavoured the expedition and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of that journey, as the laſt ſeeming period
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169951:15"/>of your deſires, after all your ſtrange and ſeverall adventures; eſteeming it as a full ſatisfaction from the gods, in recompence of your ſo many troubles and hazards: neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> will in any kinde, either endanger your perſon or reſtraine your liberty; for that, as ſuch intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatſoever, in their contentions with the King your Father (ſince there are already many of the royall Iſſue out of their power and poſſeſſion) ſo would it not onely cauſe a more generall hate upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but highly exaſperate your Uncle <hi>Orſames</hi> againſt their proceedings; to the endangering certainely, of a new Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> which no doubt but the Senate will endeavour to prevent, by all meanes poſſible they can invent.</p>
            <p>Yet however <hi>Roxana</hi> might be of theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or that ſhee onely uſed ſuch diſcourſes, the better to encourage the Princeſſe, nevertheleſſe it was not many dayes before the Senates Sea For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces declared their intentions; which was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to conduct <hi>Cloria</hi> into <hi>Lydia,</hi> reſtrained in her perſon, untill (as they ſaid) the farther plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Senate, ſhould be known concerning her particular; withall pretending they had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory commiſſion to execute according to this purpoſe; proceeding belike from the unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward endeavour of that Ambaſſadour at <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis,</hi> that had beene imployed by <hi>Philos,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Loves between <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus:</hi> As for <hi>Dedalus,</hi> all the conditions he could procure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169951:15"/>for himſelfe, was, upon their undertaking to pay him thirty Talents for the diſcharge of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the defraying of his neceſſary expences, preſently to lay downe Armes and quit the Iſland of <hi>Creet;</hi> though if he pleaſed being ſo agreed between them, he might viſit the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> untill ſuch time he ſhould more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly prepare his occaſions, for his abſolute tranſportation into forraigne parts.</p>
            <p>'Tis true <hi>Roxana</hi> caſt about many wayes in her working thoughts, how yet to alter or prevent theſe determinations of carrying the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> into <hi>Lydia</hi> a priſoner: firſt ſhee fancies to ſteale out of the Towne, to thoſe Forces which <hi>Dedalus</hi> had in a body entire without the Walls; and notwithſtanding the agreement to animate their ſpirits to ſtand for the Kings right and the Princeſſe ſafety: but finding they both needed neceſſary proviſions, and were in danger in their perſons hourely to be cut off by the old <hi>Cretans,</hi> that lay every where diſperſed over the whole Countrey; who hated them as they knew equall with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> ſhee thought that would be a project of no great conſequence to their benefit; then againe ſhee imagined, that perchance they might uſe ſome ſtratagem, to be conveyed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately out of the Haven, by ſome hired ſhip to that purpoſe; and by that meanes concealedly get into the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intentions: however when ſhee remembred ſhe was told, that the officers of the Senates forces, had lately not onely taken a ſtrict account of all the Veſſels that remained in the Harbour, but had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169951:16"/>alſo put in new Commanders of their owne in every ſhip, ſhe ſuppoſed with no probability what, ſoever, could they attempt ſuch a deſigne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being revealed; and then they might come to be worſe uſed in their confinement. Whereas now the Princeſſe was promiſed all honour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and reſpect according to her Dignity in the journey.</p>
            <p>And laſtly ſhe conceited, that perchance they might find not onely reception but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: but when ſhe conſidered the inconſtancy of their diſpoſitions, the rudeneſſe of their cuſtomes, with their ſeveral particular intereſts, ſhe thought it a vanity, if not a madneſſe to put in execution any ſuch deſigne, and the rather for that the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> her ſelfe, was not yet ſo perfectly recovered of her health, that ſhe could poſſibly expoſe her perſon to thoſe uncertainties, both in travel, &amp; dyet, with other inconveniences, that ſhe would neceſſarily be obliged to ſuffer amongſt thoſe unpolliſht Troopes: wherefore the old woman being in her opinion convinced in all theſe particulars, ſhee perſwaded her Miſtreſſe, with a kinde of a majeſty mixt with affability and kindneſſe, to entertaine both her fortunes, and thoſe Commanders that ſhould be deſigned to conduct her under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Senate, ſince as yet they could not by any meanes learne what probably might be reſolved of, concerning the farther diſpoſure of their perſons, upon their arrivall in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not many dayes when the Princeſſe <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:169951:16"/>had declared her ſelfe, both fit and willing, to undertake a journey, that the Admirall at Sea, who had been ſent out by the direction of the Ambaſſadour, that remained as was formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at <hi>Memphis,</hi> conducted the ſweet Princeſſe with her governeſſe into his own ſhip, where he had prepared a magnificent Cabin for her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whether ſo adorned out of any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby the better to win her beliefe, or out of the humanity of his own nature I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: yet ſo it was, in that unwelcome Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that both the Fleet and the Seas themſelves received them with a proſperous Wind, which in two dayes and a night or thereabouts, landed them in the faire and ancient Haven of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> where they repoſed not much longer, before they were conveyed by many gallant Troopes of horſe (by the Senates directions) to a brave Caſtle of the Kings, ſeated upon a hill not very far off the great City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where they had not onely time enough to reſt, but to exerciſe abundantly their own thoughts, ſince as they knew they were confined, ſo were they in a manner out of hope to know for how long.</p>
            <p>Some weekes after the ſaid Princeſſe, and her affectionate Governeſſe, had remained impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Caſtle, which the Senat had ordered for their confinement, ſpending their time for the moſt part in fruitleſſe complaints, accompanied with more Teares, of a ſudden <hi>Roxana</hi> one day as ſhee was ſitting in a low Parlor, that opened a Balcona-window into the parke, where many tame Deere grazed, that all the winter were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169951:17"/>to be fed by the hand, for the pleaſure formerly of the King, who upon his retirement from troubleſome affaires, would repaire thither for the better privacy of recreation, was ſalluted by a young gentleman, of more then ordinary beauty and comlineſſe of perſon, who after he had with a certaine winning behaviour made up between confidence and humility, beſtowed ſome complements upon her, he uttered this language: Madam ſaid he, not finding the excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſo apt and capable for my diſcourſe at preſent, as I wiſh ſhe were, in regard of thoſe deſparing ſorrowes, that ſeem to cloud ſo many admirable perfections, that were wont to give new luſtres to the world, and may againe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ominous interpoſitions, that ſeem to be governed, not onely by a cruell but a moſt preſumptuous and unmannerly fate, if ſhee can but be wrought to ſuch a confidence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life of my intentions, concerning her ſervice, as is not onely convenient but moſt neceſſary for the ſeaſon: for however the office I now ſeem to hold under the Senats juriſdiction, is cauſe I muſt confeſſe of ſuſpition enough, to the moſt ſtrongeſt perſwaſions, yet I call all the gods to witneſſe, who beſt know my heart, that I harbour never a thought inwardly that doth not entirely wiſh a moſt ſupreame happineſſe to every action, that <hi>Evarchus</hi> can thinke may againe bring him to the uttermoſt height, of all his ancient honours and Dignities, though the circumſtances and reaſons of my affections, in regard of my preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſo many and various at this time to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169951:17"/>diſputed: but if this beliefe of my loyalty, ſhall take that place with your charity, as I humbly deſire it may, I ſhall then diſcover unto you ſuch paſſages, lately come to my knowledge, that will not only probably ſecure the Princeſſe from a ſtorme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon her, which perhaps ſhee would moſt willingly avoid, but alſo put her in a way of ſo abſolute a happineſſe, that I dare be hold to ſay, neither her hopes nor yours can yet arrive unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana</hi> however ſhe knew not (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his violent profeſſions) how to be over confident of his intentions, yet in regard both of the neceſſity of their condition, as alſo having ſome kind of reaſons given her, by the earneſtneſſe of his language, and the ingenuity of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to be ſomething plyable to his diſcourſe, ſhe thought it at leaſtwiſe the ſafeſt way, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his offer without any ſeeming jealouſie, whatſoever: And to this purpoſe, after ſhe had abundantly thanked him for his extraordinary curteſie, ſhe told him, both her Ladies obligations and her owne, would be exceedingly augmented, by any information he ſhould give of the Senats intentions, ſince as yet they could ſinde nothing but effects of their cruelty; And much more if by his aſſiſtance, they might winde themſelves out of their preſent troubles and future dangers.</p>
            <p>Then Lady ſaid he, as the ſtory I have to tell, concernes Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> fortunes, ſince his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of <hi>Lydia,</hi> wherein the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> is involv'd, ſo muſt I deſire your leave to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all thoſe circumſtances that belong to the relation, however perhaps they may not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169951:18"/>judged ſo neceſſary to the matter, by your diſcerning judgement, yet in regard the paſſages cannot be but ſomething delightfull to your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I ſhall make bold to preſume upon your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſince truly they are both admirable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſt all beliefe:</p>
            <p>Know then, that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> at his being at the Court of <hi>Lydia,</hi> though his buſineſſe in outward view ſeemed to pretend to nothing, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing aſſiſtance from the King, to regaine his loſt Countrey of <hi>Iberia,</hi> yet ſecretly I muſt tell you, he fell in love with the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> which however he durſt not diſcover: In this poſture he continued between hope and deſpaire, untill the arrivall of the old Queen <hi>Anaxia,</hi> as he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved drowned all his encouragements, in a vaſt Sea of impoſſibility, for that ſhe brought with her in her journey, certaine propoſitions full of honour and benefit to <hi>Evarchus</hi> Court, from the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> concerning a marriage betweene the faire Princeſſe and his Son and Heire <hi>Oſiris,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Caſſianus</hi> that night, when all the world was imployed about the triumphant ſports, that were deſigned for the entertainment of the Queen of <hi>Syria,</hi> to leave <hi>Lydia:</hi> belike being put on to thoſe reſolutions, by his melancholly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, which however as you very well know ſo enflamed the whole Kingdome, by the ſpightfull practiſes of factious <hi>Dimogoras</hi> joyned with the crafty inſinuations of others of the ſame intereſt; that it proved a maine occaſion that ſince hath diſquieted the King in his government.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caſſianus</hi> himſelfe who had left <hi>Lydia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169951:18"/>certaine blacke clouds of malignant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, that afterwards became furious ſtormes of bloud and ſlaughter (though I cannot ſay he was any way guilty in their effects; for Princes Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and intereſts are oftentimes abuſed to ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends and purpoſes) retired in perſon, under the juriſdiction of an ancient Forreſt, not many dayes journey from the Court, where ſometimes he privately lived, delighting his ſolitary inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the exerciſe of hunting, and other rurall delights, which thoſe pleaſant woods, and that fruitfull Countrey plentifully afforded his nature and fortune: but not long it was before <hi>Hyacinthia</hi> our Queen alſo, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of <hi>Lydia,</hi> was forced to quit her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Kingdome by which accident as you know ſhe met in that place, with the company of her baniſhed brother <hi>Candalus,</hi> outed in like manner of all his happineſſe, by the powerfull authority of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> great favourite to <hi>Orſames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As moſt of theſe paſſages were within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of your owne intelligence, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated onely for my ſtories better method, ſo now I ſhall preſume to informe you of ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as you have not yet heard of; for <hi>Caſſianus</hi> remaining as I ſaid in the delightfull Forreſt, and going under the borrowed and abbreviated name of <hi>Caſſa,</hi> being diſguiſed in the habit of a young huntſman, upon the Queenes arrivall, preſented himſelfe to your view though not to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: by which encounter, he was encouraged, againe to proſecute his old love (almoſt laid aſleep by time and ſeparation, to the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169951:19"/>ſince the conveniency (as he thought) could not be bettered; and in that manner reſolved to wait upon the Queen undiſcovered into <hi>Syria:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe in that intended voyage as you know, both himſelfe and <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſuffered ſhipwrack; however <hi>Caſſianns</hi> (though the other periſhed) by the proſpitiouſneſſe of the heavens, eſcaped in a manner miraculouſly the deſperate danger of the Sea, and entered into ſuch adventures as ſcarce can be paralleld: for his body being ſupported, upon a flat cheſt full of Jewells belonging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by the onely flowing of the water, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into certaine Nets belonging to poor fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who finding a young man full of beauty, though almoſt dead by the violent agitation of the waves, after they had recovered ſome life in him, preſented him to a Lords daughter of the Country called <hi>Briſania,</hi> as a ſubject worth her beſt compaſſion; but the Lady-whether taken with the youth and beauty of her patient, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an inclination to affect that ſhe had once preſerved, of a ſudden fell in love with his lovely perſon, ſince ſhe had no motives to be inticed by the knowledge of his Titles, he having concealed himſelfe, the better to performe his intended journey into <hi>Syria:</hi> and this love at laſt from ſmall ſparcles, began to encreaſe to a great flame, though for a long time <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Ladies paſſions; for her virgin modeſty ever ſuppreſt the declaration of that which ſhee had much adoe to hide, untill the ſecret fire was diſcovered by the ſharp ſight of another Suitor, that had already procured the good will of her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169951:19"/>Father for their future marriage; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding another Rivall by a more noble love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the former for preheminence: In the interim that theſe intricate affections ſeemed to act ſeverall parts, the old Lord by his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death, left his faire daughter to inherite rather misfortune, then juriſdiction; For <hi>Fridius</hi> her hated Lover (being ſo called) preſently ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed both upon her Perſon and Country, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that her Father in his laſt will, had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him the ſole governour of her Minority, leaſt ſhe might endanger both her honour and ſafety by ſome inconſiderable match; reſolving withall to make <hi>Caſſianus</hi> a Sacrifice or a Petitioner to compaſſe his ends: to which purpoſe, he cauſed him publickly to be accuſed, that he intended to have betrayed the Towne and Conutrey to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power; under pretence of freeing <hi>Briſania</hi> from priſon, who ſeemed alſo to have conſented to the practice, whereby to have procured her own releaſement. And this being falſely laid to his charge he was unjuſtly condemned; however <hi>Fridius</hi> ſuſpended the execution untill he had not onely againe attempted the Ladies conſent to his offered Love, but procured <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> who went by the borrowed name of <hi>Caſſa,</hi> to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Sollicitor in his ſuit; which opportunely gave <hi>Briſania</hi> occaſion, inſtead of granting <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> his requeſt, to diſcover her own love; but <hi>Caſſianus</hi> became rather confuſed then pleaſed at this diſcovery, ſince the hazard of his own life could but purchaſe the acceptance; in ſo much as onely with a ſorrowfull courtſhip he entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169951:20"/>her diſcourſe, however ſhe gave him leave to depart, and carry her peremptory denyall to the proud Tyrant. Nevertheleſſe poore <hi>Caſſa</hi> was to be made the object of his ſpleen, ſince <hi>Briſania</hi> would not be the ſubject of his love; for ſome few dayes after he was brought to a publicke ſcaffold erected before the Caſtle window, where <hi>Briſania</hi> remained, that ſhe might be the better witneſſe of the bloudy Tragedy intended; <hi>Caſſa</hi> appeared in a mourning habit, becomming the ſadneſſe of his preſent condition, but much more clouded in his ſorrowfull countenance, that ſhewed his dejected minde; though his beauty had yet ſo large a poſſeſſion in his perſon by the opinion of the people, that he ſeemed a Sun ſhaded in a dark skie, that notwithſtanding ſhot forth bright beames under the blacke coverture; And in this manner was lead to the Theater of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their liberall lamentation, ſince theſe were the onely ſacrifices they could offer in his behalfe; for although he was eſteemed amongſt them but a private Gentleman of <hi>Iberia,</hi> yet could they not chuſe but grieve to ſee a Youth of his naturall perfections, untimely brought to his deſtruction, by the cruelty of a wicked Tyrant: But in the meane time poore <hi>Briſania</hi> ſummoned to the ſpectacle by the noyſe of the ſpectators, at the firſt ſight began to feele new paſſions in her gentle boſome, not ſo much of love as pitty, ſince the priſoner himſelfe had by divers meſſages ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited her to yield, rather then to make him the onely object of <hi>Fridius</hi> his hate: wherefore, firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169951:20"/>ſhe laid before her thoughts the innocency of the priſoner that was to ſuffer, onely becauſe ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued wilfull.

By which declaration it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169951:21"/>was quickly knowne throughout all the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, that <hi>Briſanias</hi> firſt Suitor had both ſaved <hi>Caſſa</hi> from deſtruction, and poſſeſt himſelfe of the City, who hearing of the cruell captivity of his deere Miſtreſſe by the wicked tyranny of <hi>Fridius,</hi> had aſſembled all his friends to her reſcue, and by a neat ſtratagem, had happily brought about the deſigne for her delivery, and her enemies pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: <hi>Fridius</hi> ſufficiently apprehenſive of the guilt of his own Treaſon, ſtaid not to diſpute the right of his cauſe with his victorious rivall, but preſently retired under the ſafe protection of the ſtrong Caſtle, where he ſuppoſed was a Garriſon able to contend, whilſt other ſuccors came to his aſſiſtance; beſides he had <hi>Briſania</hi> in his power, by whoſe authority and Title he imagined the better to retaine the obedience of the People. But <hi>Saxanius</hi> intending neither to be ſlothfull in his love or hate; after he had given ſome orders for the ſurer obedience of the Towne, ſoon placed a formall ſiege before the Fort where his Miſtreſſe was impriſoned, with ſo great a probability of prevailing that within ſome few dayes he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Meſſage from wicked <hi>Fridius,</hi> that if he did not preſently retire himſelfe and his Troopes from before the Caſtle, he vow'd by all the gods that <hi>Briſania</hi> ſhould act the firſt part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance of his intention, he cauſed the Lady to be brought upon the Leades, where were already prepared the circumſtances of her death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxanius</hi> after he had underſtood this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169951:21"/>demand from the proud Tyrant, and beheld with his ſorrowfull eyes the threatned danger of his faire Miſtreſſe, for whoſe ſafety he had inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not onely his owne courage, but the valours alſo of all his friends and kindred, became tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with many thoughts, and divers reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince if he abſolutely performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding requeſt of his hated rivall, he was no more ſecured (as he ſuppoſed) of <hi>Briſania's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, then if he ſhould yield to nothing he deſired, but rather gave <hi>Fridius</hi> the more liberty to be cruell, when he had no occaſion to feare; And for any promiſe he could make, it was to be eſteemed like the reſt of his falſe actions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he almoſt determined to ſend away the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralde</hi> with a threatning deniall, inſtead of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive conſent. But then reflecting upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his deare love, who as he believed, would imagine that he eſteemed much more a little honour then the ſaving of her life, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his former halfe reſolution, and entered him againe into new and confuſed conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were loſt in his deſperate breaſt with diverſity of paſſions, untill caſting his ſad eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where <hi>Briſania</hi> was, as a pure ſacrifice to be offered according to his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſeemed in his apprehenſion already to accuſe him of unworthy love, that could ſo long diſpute in his minde her preſervation; of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he might ſee one caſt headlong from the top of the Caſtle into the ditch; which too ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his beliefe that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgement, by performing the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169951:22"/>before the returne of his meſſenger: ſo that he remained like one that ſeemed to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a marble Statute, untill a flagge of Truce appeared joyfully upon the Caſtle, as a teſtimony of future friendſhip: however <hi>Saxanius</hi> could not be ſatisfied in the <hi>Omen,</hi> untill a Meſſenger from the Fort aſſured him not onely of the Ladies ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo of the death of <hi>Fridius;</hi> with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the Souldiers of the Fort, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure their Princeſſe captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force reſcued their Miſtreſſe, and committed a ſupreame Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſon; who now was ſent from <hi>Briſania</hi> to know what conditions the beſiegers expected both for her liberty and the Towne they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conquered. But <hi>Saxanius</hi> would make no Articles at all with his Love, for after he had diſpoſed of his Troopes into ſeverall Quarters, he went to preſent himſelfe a ſlave to the faire Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he had redeemed, where he intended to chaine his freedome for ever. However <hi>Caſſianus</hi> finding that he was not onely fallen into ſome diſdaine by reaſon of thoſe deſires he expreſt for his own preſervation, as alſo <hi>Saxanius</hi> likely to take poſſeſſion of thoſe favours he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no way to preſerve him ſtill in the good will of his Lady, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his quality, which he ſuppoſed would both advance his eſteeme, and leſſen his rivals credit; and by that meanes become a publicke pretender to <hi>Briſania;</hi> which notwithſtanding produced no other effects then a challenge from <hi>Saxanius,</hi> which <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in honour could not refuſe, after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169951:22"/>he had given ſufficient teſtimonies of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a Prince and no wandring ſtranger. Yet however the day was appointed for the combate, and every ones expectation attended the finall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the quarrell, <hi>Briſania's</hi> nurſe called <hi>Rhena</hi> promiſed to ſatisfie all parties without danger or bloud, provided her Miſtreſſe would be directed by her Counſells, and become wife to him whom the heavens had ordained to be her husband.</p>
            <p>This ſtrange intricacy gave curious deſires to multitudes of people to be preſent at the wonder, ſince both the Champions were reſolved not to be foyled in their honour, ſcarce in their loves; Wherefore they came into the Field armed, to ſupply the defect of the old womans performance, according to her bold promiſe: but when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a bloudy encounter. <hi>Rhena</hi> intreated them they would firſt repaire to the great Temple to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the immortall gods, where ſhe ſaid, ſhe might perhaps relate ſuch a ſtory, that would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all their deſires. This propoſition from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of according the rivalls, their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell being grounded upon a difference that knew not how to admit of any competition, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude it ſelfe ſeemed to have no place in <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> diſpoſition, though he enjoyed his life by the fortunate favour of <hi>Saxanius;</hi> yet by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate cryes of the people who began to be leſſe curious and more pittifull, they were perſwaded to follow her directions; and being before the Altar encompaſſed round about by the expecting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169951:23"/>multitude, <hi>Rhena</hi> after ſhe had called the heavens to witneſſe of the truth of what ſhe intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as ſhe ſaid, ſhe had bound her ſelf by a vow never to declare, untill ſome neceſſity not to be avoyded forced from her the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>When beautious <hi>Elizana</hi> ſaid ſhe, the vertuous mother of Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> here preſent, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with her deare Husband, to flye from the Countrey of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> by the prevailing power of <hi>Artaxes</hi> generall, in the way being great with child, ſhe was forced to retire to the houſe of my late Lord, Father to <hi>Briſania,</hi> whoſe wife was her neere kinſwoman, and at the ſame time great alſo, where ſhe had not remained many dayes before ſhe was delivered of a faire daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole houſe: however, the gods eſteeming my Miſtreſſe too good for this life, took her out of this world before ſhe had finiſhed the moneth of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, to the unſpeakable ſadneſſe both of her husband, and all her ſervants, leaving no iſſue to inherit her ſingular vertues but a daughter only. <hi>Elizana</hi> alſo being quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as my Lord alſo truſted me with his jewel: but accidents and the warres in <hi>Armenia</hi> growing every day more hot then other, for the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and quiet, I was perſwaded with the two children, to retire to my own houſe, where we remained for ſome yeares, they contented to be each others companion, as I happy to be both their Foſter mother, ſince they increaſed not ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169951:23"/>faſt in dayes and nights as in beauty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but alaſſe the Fates were envious at our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and tooke one of them out of the world, and with theſe words, the old woman wept with the remembrance of her deare loſſe, untill her many Teares running downe her aged cheekes gave ſome interruption to her diſcourſe: but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her griefe was ſcarce ſeaſonable to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate multitude, ſhe wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the warre ſaid ſhe became ſo qualified, that Parents had ſome lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to enjoy the comfort of their children, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my Lord with a beautifull daughter; though for the other I had in charge, I deſired his favour to make my excuſe, ſince it was not in my power to prevent the will of the gods, which gave him ſo much ſatisfaction, that he perſwaded <hi>Elizana</hi> by letter to be content that had many more, which continued untill my Lady <hi>Briſania</hi> by his late death as you know became heire to all his poſſeſſions, though interrupted ſome time by wicked <hi>Fridius,</hi> and redeemed by valiant <hi>Saxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to whom without a great deale of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe cannot but give her ſelfe, and all that ſhe hath, ſince ſhe hath received it from his hands. At which words <hi>Caſſianus</hi> began to muſter up within his breſt a multitude of paſſions, untill the old woman turning towards him told him, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe would render him ſatisfied alſo: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after the people were a little quieted in their confuſed murmur, ſhe thus ended her ſtory: But now ſaid ſhe to unriddle this myſtery, and fully to performe my promiſe, I muſt let know, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169951:24"/>
               <hi>Briſania</hi> wat not child to your late deceaſed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but daughter to worthy <hi>Elizana;</hi> I onely uſing that fallacy upon the death of the other, becauſe I feared the loſſe to my Lord would have proved a vexation intollerable, ſince he wanted children to inherit his fortune and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and for <hi>Elizana,</hi> I ſuppoſed the croſſe would not appeare ſo great, in reſpect of the bountifulneſſe of the iſſue which the gods had beſtowed upon her; however I made a private vow to my ſelfe as I ſaid, never to diſcover this myſtery, untill ſome preſſing occaſion forced from me the declaration, aſwell to retaine <hi>Briſania</hi> in her ſuppoſed Fathers poſſeſſions, as to take from their Parents all jealouſie of my fraude. But ſince the heavens by the power and right of conqueſt, have now eſtabliſh't my Lord <hi>Saxanius</hi> in that government which <hi>Briſania</hi> did intend innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uſurpe, and that his noble pretentions to her love deſerve her beſt entertainment, as if the Gods intended a perpetuall unity in their hearts againſt all obſtacles, I hope it will be the opinion of all here preſent, that the marriage between them be ſolemnized inſtantly in the Temple; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that I cannot doubt Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> will forbid the conjunction, ſince nature denies him the capacity of ſuch a happineſſe. This declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was quickly warranted by the deſires of all the people with loude acclamations, ſo that <hi>Briſania</hi> turning about to <hi>Saxanius</hi> with a bluſh that more enflamed his joy, after a little pawſe ſaluted him with this language: My Lord ſaid ſhe, for ſo it ſhould ſeeme the deſtinies have deſigned you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169951:24"/>all difficulties, though whether I ſhall be now eſteemed worthy in your vertuous thoughts to give you that Title may be ſome queſtion, ſince your noble addreſſes formerly received not thoſe ready entertainements they merited: however, I ſhall endeavour to perſwade you to believe that the heavens have had a ſecret influence whereby the better to unite our ſelves, ſince my prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affection to my Brother upon ſmall grounds endeavoured ſomething to obſcure your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in my apprehenſion, which now appeare to my knowledge in a moſt full and affectionate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that abſolutely delights all my ſenſes. And with that, as if ſhe had been too liberall in her language, like a Roſe over-preſt with the nights dew, by little and little caſt downe her lovely lookes upon the ground. <hi>Saxanius</hi> inſtead of delivering his judgement concerning <hi>Briſania's</hi> plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle kiſſe upon her faire lips, which gave the people ſufficient intelligence of his thoughts, ſo that the marriage became preſently ſolemnized, to the content of all the ſtanders by, but more ſpecially to themſelves, whoſe happineſſe could not fully be apprehended but in the fruition one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And this Madam, I ſay, is the delightfull, though intricate ſtory of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> adventures, ſince his departure out of <hi>Lydia,</hi> which he was pleaſed to ſignifie in writing under his own hand; however to none but to his faithfull friend and chiefeſt counſellour <hi>Dimogoras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now that I have entertained your eares with theſe ſtrange though pleaſant paſſages; as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169951:25"/>I may ſay, ſeemingly rather miracles, then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I ſhall come neerer a great deale to your concernments: This intelligence of the ſafety of the Prince, you muſt know, enflamed the thoughts of <hi>Dimogoras;</hi> whereupon he began to conſider if a marriage could be compaſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cloria</hi> the Kings daughter and <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> it would undoubtedly, not onely ſtrengthen his own greatneſſe, but exceedingly fortifie all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contentions of the Senate, with <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King, ſince by this means his daughter ſhould not be matched to any forrain Prince, that might give her father aſſiſtance; but rather by degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſires.</p>
            <p>With theſe conſiderations he went preſently to the Senate, whereby to make them acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the intelligence he had received. To this purpoſe, being ſat in the Councell, he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this kind of ſpeech, with as much eloquence as his naturall roughneſſe, and want of education could deliver.</p>
            <p>My Lords, ſaid he, as it is moſt evident, the gods have hitherunto proſpered our attempts in a moſt admirable manner, to the wonder of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo of the other ſide may we againe behold, a kind of miraculous influence depending upon thoſe accidents, fignified unto you by Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Letters: Theſe things being conſidered, I ſee no reaſon, nay I may boldly affirme there is a great deale of piety in the reſolution, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſervice of the gods, as alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſtabliſhing of our own affaires, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169951:25"/>endeavour all waies poſſible, to unite the perſons and affections, of <hi>Cloria</hi> the Kings daughter, and <hi>Caſſianus</hi> the advent'rous Prince, in ſuch indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ties of love and marriage, that may not onely render them happy themſelves, but ſecure us from all feare of a forraigne conjunction, that undoubtedly would diſorder (if not deſtroy) that work we have already wiſely begun, and hope ſhall fortunately end in this Kingdome. For my part, I muſt confeſſe, I doe almoſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet, when I conſider in how great a hazzard our affaires ſtood, before your Admirall ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Princeſs at <hi>Pergame;</hi> for that the alliance intended between her ſelfe and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> could not have been other than ominous; when as of the other ſide, we are moſt aſſured, to finde <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> upon all occaſions, not onely a furtherer of our deſignes, but a lover of our perſons. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may be a little ſtartled with the doubts, that <hi>Cloria</hi> will ſcarce be brought to think of ſuch Nuptials; but truly theſe are meerly frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſiderations, in compariſon of benefits of States, and Kingdoms; wherefore I ſay, If ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to yield her conſent, by the influence of his Courtſhip, ſhe muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> be preſently ſent for, not onely to put in execution, with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what we ſhall determine for our own happineſſe, and the Kingdomes welfare; but alſo to be honoured and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our former reſolution and promiſes.

To this purpoſe, after ſome few daies ſhe became informed, that he was a young Nobleman of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> called <hi>Creſes,</hi> imployed by the Senate in the government of the Countrey about the Caſtle, which made her alſo obſerve his actions, whereby ſhe might learn, whether it were a new inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted duty that taught him better obedience to the Kings ſervice then formerly; or whether ſome diſcontent of his other Lords proceedings at <hi>Sardis,</hi> in regard of his own perſon, cauſed him revengefully to put off his truſt. But as within the compaſſe of ſome weeks ſhe was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it was neither of theſe reaſons that gave him an appetite to leave his command, and begin a new loyalty to his King; ſo of the other ſide ſhe became aſſured in her opinion, that his ſecret love to the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> was the principall cauſe that made him offer ſo acceptable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the hazzard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into many conſiderations with her Miſtreſſe, whether it were better with ſecurity of their perſons, ſtill to remaine in the Caſtle, where they were under the juriſdiction of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and to expect the vexations of <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> importunity upon his arrivall, as <hi>Creſes</hi> had informed them, or hazard themſelves under the protection of the new lover, whoſe diſpoſition and intention they were not acquainted withall; nevertheleſſe, after long debate they fell upon the

            <p>This diſcourſe or rather paſſion of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, proceeding as 'twas ſuppoſed from the hard going of her horſe, gave <hi>Cloria</hi> occaſion to tell her in a gentle ſmile, that the reaſon why they did not practice ſuch paſtimes, was becauſe they wanted good horſes for the ſport, and Coaches at ſhe had heard were not then in uſe: good hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I cannot tell what you call good, but for my part I was never worſe carried then at the preſent; at which the Princeſſe began to laugh out-right, ſince ſhe had ſo directly hit upon the diſeaſe of her Governeſſe.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169951:29"/>no whit amended in the choyce, ſhewed the defect proceeded from her age, and not from her Steede: Nevertheleſſe, moſt couragiouſly (though ſhe did ſweat for the buſineſſe) ſhe arrived at the Forreſt, where they intended to repoſe themſelves for the noone ſeaſon, that required ſome ſhade againſt the Suns violence; <hi>Creſes</hi> choſe a flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Tree for the Princeſſe accommodation, which contented her thoughts as well as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt Canopy of State in her fathers Court, and the proviſion that the dwarfe had brought with him abundantly ſatisfied inſtead of other curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: theſe ſatisfactions exacted from <hi>Cloria</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary duty, that the night paſt had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely debaured her of, which was ſhewed by the gentle cloſing of her faire eyes from the dayes light; whilſt in the meane time <hi>Roxana</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, after ſhe had put ſomething under her Ladies head, to retire her ſelfe under another tree to be indulgent alſo to her owne ſenſes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Creſes</hi> whoſe love and care cauſed him to be a diligent Sentinell over the Princeſſes reſt, afforded him alſo the happineſſe of this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, in which faine he would have ſtollen a kiſſe, but that he feared the heavens would have revealed the theft: can the gods (thought he) be altogether ſtupid to ſuffer ſo divine a creature upon earth, and leave their own habitation bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of ſuch excellence, ſince more then a thouſand <hi>Cupids</hi> are ready to offer ſacrifices upon the pure Altar of her faire forehead, perfumed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of her odoriferous breath? can theſe two illuſtrious cherries ſaid he, that onely kiſſe one

            <p>Many dayes they had not travelled in this large Forreſt, to ſeeke out obſcure wayes to prevent ſurprize, ſince they ſuppoſed they ſhould haſtily be purſued if not encountered by ſome of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates Forces, lying in a manner every night, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169951:30"/>in a poor Cottage, or in the open aire, which the couragious Princeſſe underwent with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable fortitude, hoping her reward at laſt ſhould be not onely to ſee her deare Father, but to heare ſome newes of her love <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> for whoſe ſake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they arrived at a ſmall playn encompaſſed with wood, which the more flouriſhed, becauſe <hi>Phaebus</hi> had not ſo abſolute a dominion in that place as elſewhere. At the farther end of the Plaine upon the riſing of a little hill, that directed its view towards the Eaſt, they might behold a houſe; though not of any appearing capacity, to containe many perſons: but long they had not contemplated the commodity of their ſuppoſed nights lodging, ere they ſpyed an. old Father with his booke in his hand, ſitting under a Tree, which gave occaſion to <hi>Creſes,</hi> whilſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and <hi>Roxana</hi> were content to take ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that ſolitude, to preſent himſelfe to the aged man, aſwell to be informed who he was, as alſo to receive ſome benefit by his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore after they had civilly ſaluted one another, and that <hi>Creſes</hi> had told him he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted certaine diſtreſſed Ladies towards <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> where their friends remained in the Kings warres, and alſo that they wanted for the preſent accommodation of lodging for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching night, the old man ſeemed not onely willing to pleaſure him in any thing, but of the ſudden burſt forth into abundance of Teares and complaints, as it ſhould ſeem at the remembrance of <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his fortunes, which made <hi>Creſes</hi>

            <p>Sir ſaid he, ſince you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you muſt know in my youth I was bred by the carefull induſtry of my parents a ſcholler, which profeſſion brought me firſt in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with my Prince <hi>Euarchus</hi> Father, who was himſelfe not onely learned, but exceedingly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the converſation of thoſe that were poſſeſſed with ſuch qualities, which at the firſt joyned with the ambition of my owne nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation as I thought, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from me a diligence to preferment, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, honours were but moderately conferred upon me, during the life of the old King; though after his death his ſonne <hi>Euarchus,</hi> whether miſtaking my ability or being in love with my fidelity, ſhowred downe ſo many favours upon me, that I not onely in a ſhort time, became chiefe <hi>Flamin</hi> of all <hi>Lydia,</hi> but in a manner governed the whole State under the King, which heaped on me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient envy; and the rather ſince I conferred many offices poſſeſſed formerly by the Nobility upon thoſe of my owne profeſſion, whereby the better to ſtrengthen my party, and dignifie my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In this poſture I remained untill the great Senate that now rules in <hi>Lydia</hi> chaced me from

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169951:32"/>of being cruelly puniſhed for the eſcape: ſo that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

When they had ſufficiently digeſted theſe reſolutions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, they both roſe from their ſeats to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to <hi>Cloria;</hi> the Princeſſe at their approach entertained the <hi>Flamine,</hi> with the ſame affection ſhe conceived to be due to one, that had beene formerly honoured by her Fathers favours; whilſt he with Teares in his eyes, preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her and the reſt of the company to his ſmall habitation; excuſing notwithſtanding in a courtly phraſe, the pooreneſſe of the welcome ſhe was to expect: but long ſhe had not enjoyed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169951:32"/>the pleaſing ſecurity of that retirement, before ſhe was overtaken with a moſt horrid and inſolent treaſon in this ſort.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers that cowardly were fled from the battell, as the <hi>Flamine</hi> had related to <hi>Creſes,</hi> and were retired within the Fortifications of thoſe woods, for their better ſecurity againſt their purſuers, underſtanding by ſome intelligence that the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> was lodged privately within the old Fathers houſe, began to conſider, that if they returned her back again to the Senate at <hi>Sardis,</hi> from whence they underſtood ſhe was eſcaped, it would prove ſo acceptable, that they ſhould not onely thereby purchaſe all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, but probably many of the chiefe actors might receive conſiderable rewards. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they no ſooner entertained in their wicked and diſloyall breaſts, but the execution followed with ſo much violence, that they not onely ſeized <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> but alſo carried with them the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> as a full period to their ſupream villany, notwithſtanding all the perſwaſions could be uſed towards them; but the gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the traytors, though the Senate made uſe of the treaſon, all they could procure for this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice, was to have their lives ſaved, upon condition, they ſhould within ten daies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Kingdome; or elſe, to ſuffer preſent death whereſoever the could be found after the limited time, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>However this juſt ſentence was a deſerving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their offences, yet poore <hi>Cloria</hi> enjoyed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169951:33"/>no comfort in her captivity, but rather her croſſes were augmented by the arrivall of <hi>Caſſianus:</hi> one day when ſhe was retired into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large proportion to her ſorrows, eſteeming it the beſt converſation ſhe could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe in theſe ſad times, ſhe was of a ſudden ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prince, who conceived his power gave him a ſufficient warrant for any intruſion; where, after he had continued his courtſhip with a few complements, he ſtrived to proteſt his affection, with all the reaſons that the ſame religion, neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of kindred, and his vow'd ſervice to her father could pretend unto; which pluckt from the Princeſſe this ſharp and ſudden reply, contrary to her nature.</p>
            <p>Cozen, ſaid ſhe, although your own thoughts can beſt witneſſe the Religion you hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no ſatisfaction by your profeſſion, ſince you vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeem to runne along with that current, that ſeeks by all means poſſible to deſtroy the <hi>Lydian</hi> rights, in taking away the <hi>Flamins</hi> out of the Temples, the onely pretended occaſion now of theſe warrs between my father and his Senate, in which cuſtomes I have been brought up from my cradle.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169951:33"/>in all juſtice ſhould rather be perſwaded then compelled. And laſtly, concerning the ſervice you profeſſe to my father, as I would be glad to ſee ſome effects thereof by reall actions, inſtead of ayerie, and perhaps of falſe profeſſions; ſo of the other ſide, I muſt deſire you to remember, that Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was alwaies entertained, &amp; cheriſhed by King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> with all humanity and bounty, when his regall power was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: Wherefore in my opinion, you have no reaſon to ſide with that faction, that ſtrives to pluck the Diadem from the browes of him and his poſterity; in which number I have, or ought to have a confiderable intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> after he had received this bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, with a certain pale, if not guilty look, reſted for ſome time, as it were frozen in a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, not being able to utter one ſyllable in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of himſelfe, againſt ſuch deſperate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as he thought delivered by a heavenly Oracle: yet at laſt, leſt he might ſeem altogether conquered by the force of her reaſons, when it was impoſſible her ſweet words could wound, but with the darts of <hi>Cupid,</hi> he fearfully returned this anſwer, which reached her eares, but not her beliefe.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid he, for the differences in Religion between your father and his Senate, I eſteem them no way eſſentiall; conſiſting onely in matter of ceremony, which with a little labour may eaſily be reconciled to both their advantages. And for that bloud of yours, that ſo much honoured my birth, I could wiſh to have an occaſion to let it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169951:34"/>out from nouriſhing my heart, whereby to doe you the leaſt ſervice; though your releaſe cannot fall within the capacity of my power, ſince it is the command of the whole Kingdome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines your liberty; nevertheleſſe without any thought of injury intended to your perſon: for, if I believed the Senate had any determination to diminiſh, much leſſe to deprive your Royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe flowers which belong juſtly to his glorious Crown, I ſhould be ſo farre from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of their endeavours, that I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with all difficulties to teare the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their intentions from the face of the earth; however, I cannot deny, but I meerly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by their extraordinary bounty, ſince I have loſt the poſſeſſion of mine own Countrey, that ſhould maintain my condition. At which words the Princeſſe with a diſdainfull ſmile gave him a diſſembled thankes, accompanied by ſo ſweet and becomming a ſcorn, that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſeemed more bitter at her ſilence then by the diſpute; though <hi>Roxana</hi> could not chuſe but take her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes part, and conſequently made this cholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke anſwer to that little he had ſaid in his owne defence.</p>
            <p>My Lord ſaid ſhe, I cannot but wonder if the points in Religion be of no greater difference then you ſpeak of, that the Senate ſhould diſturbe the quiet State of <hi>Lydia</hi> with ſo much bloud and ſlaughter, to compell <hi>Euarchus</hi> to change the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when it is evident he deſires but to maintaine the profeſſion of his Father without alteration; nay rather me thinks it would have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169951:34"/>beene greater markes of their piety, to have given way to the Kings humour in ſo ſmall a thing of conſequence, then to have bought the alteration at ſo deare and dangerous a price. And for the latter part of your diſcourſe, I ſhall onely put you in minde, that as your Uncles love and bounty never failed you, when he was in a flouriſhing proſperity, ſo you may doe nobly to pay his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſt, and his neceſſities preſent, with teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of gratitude and duty. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> although he vowed to the uttermoſt of his power, he did and would render him his beſt endeavours, yet he quickly changed the ſubject of the diſcourſe, pretending that love at the preſent, was more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his diſpoſition then hate, and therefore began againe to court the Princeſſe with freſh complements: however when he found with a neglectfull ſilence ſhe onely ſeemed to heare his words, without a will to underſtand the matter, as if ſhe were leſſe pleaſed with thoſe ſmiles then with the Senates frownes, he abruptly quitted the roome with a kinde of a darke clowde in his lookes: within two dayes after this encounter the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> was brought before the great Senate to receive his tryall, not onely for having been in his court imployments a diſturber of the State as 'twas pretended by his ill councell to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus,</hi> but at the preſent for being an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convey the Princeſſe out of the Senates protection, and conceale her perſon in his houſe, whereby to marry her to ſome forraigne power that might indanger the proſperity of <hi>Lydia.</hi> Which accuſations were ſo ſpightfully alleadged
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169951:35"/>againſt him, with ſuch prejudicate reſolutions for his ruine, that the old man had not force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to ſuſtaine the waight of the proſecution, though he expreſt a competent courage in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſo was condemned publikely to loſe his head upon a Scaffold in the view of all the people, who at leaſtwiſe appeared contented if not pleaſed at the novelty.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cloria</hi> when ſhe heard of this ſudden, and as ſhe conceived horrid determination, was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a noble compaſſion, not onely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the old man to have been a moſt faithfull ſervant to her Father, but unfortunate by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tragedy, onely for entertaining her at his houſe, as a teſtimony of his loyalty to the royall Family, which wrought in her gentle ſoule divers perturbations: Firſt ſhe conſidered, that if he ſuffered, it would be ſome ſtaine to her honour, ſince he appeared rather to be a Martyr for her, then for himſelfe; which obligation ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to undergoe without ſome teſtimonies of a ſupreame gratitude; yet then when ſhe reflected upon that ſubmiſſion ſhe muſt uſe to beg his life of the Senate, ſhe thought the ſacrifice of an old <hi>Flamine,</hi> who e're long could not chuſe but be an offering to the earth, would not prejudice his owne happineſſe, much leſſe taxe her of ill nature; And therefore became halfe perſwaded to let him runne his laſt period with glory, rather then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſupplyant to her Fathers Subjects for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: yet after much conteſtation with her ſelfe, the vertuous Princeſſe fell upon this apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſhe in a manner became the author
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169951:35"/>of ill, by omitting that good ſhe had power to doe, and by that meanes ſhould deſerve the worlds cenſure: ſo that pitty, gratitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſeemed to contend with courage, honour, and diſdaine, till at laſt ſhe flew to this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſend for <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> and conjure him by the hopes of his deſired love, to be ſo farre an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the poore <hi>Flamins</hi> behalfe, as to preſerve him from deſtraction by his power or intereſt; though againe when ſhe entered into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what a jealous ſcruple the requeſt might raiſe in <hi>Narciſſus</hi> thoughts, if ever he ſhould come to know of the action, it almoſt deſtroyed the piouſneſſe of her intention: nevertheleſſe ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Roxana,</hi> and wiſht her in her name to fetch <hi>Caſſianus</hi> to ſpeake with her, ſince her reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not long to be protracted, if ſhe had a will they ſhould prove effectuall; yet as the old woman was going out of the doore to performe her meſſage, ſhe ſuddenly commanded her backe againe, labouring as it were in her inconſtant conſtancy, untill <hi>Roxana</hi> her ſelf being diſpleaſed with her fruitleſſe irreſolutions, at length went without her leave.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caſſianus</hi> came, he found the Princeſſe ſeated not onely in a darke chamber, but inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thoſe mourning Curtaines about her bed, which ſhe had cauſed to be hung up ſince her laſt impriſonment, as teſtimonies of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented State ſhe conceived her ſelfe in: when <hi>Roxana</hi> had informed her of the Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to attend her pleaſure, after ſhe had with a low voyce deſired him to ſit downe in a chaire
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169951:36"/>neere her, ſhe uſed this diſcourſe unto him.</p>
            <p>Couſin ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible you can thinke, that the bload of the poore and aged <hi>Flamine</hi> may be ſo acceptable an offering to the gods, as to make them thereby more propitious to your deſires? or doe you believe, that my love which you ſeeme to hope for, will be perſwaded eaſily by the cruelty of ſo horrid a ſacrifice? if you meane to threaten inſtead of intreaing, perhaps you may pleaſe your owne nature, but never I can aſſure you, compell my liking, ſince I finde in my ſoule ſo much courage yet left, notwithſtanding all my misfortunes, as not to give away my affections to one that hath merited ſo much juſt hate from me. Certainely you are miſtaken to thinke <hi>Cypres</hi> branches are fit orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to become a marriage bed, for the many examples in that kinde have beene alwayes prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; can you flatter ſo farre your owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as to apprehend the ſlaughter of my friends, and ſlaughtered chiefly for my ſervice, can create leſſe effects in me, then a revenge when I ſhall have power to execute it according to my will, upon thoſe that have occaſioned my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? It ſhould be ſtrange they ſhould expect to be entertained in my boſome, that have ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully procured my diſgracefull diſcontent. No Couſin, aſſure your ſelfe, theſe are not the wayes to captivate a Virgins gentle heart, or to truſt proteſtations of ſuch a Suitor, that wanted not hate in the higheſt profeſſions of his love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſianus</hi> after he had heard theſe words from the Princeſſe, haſtily without any reply at all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169951:36"/>tooke his leave; which not onely gave occaſion of many conjectures both to <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> but alſo of ſome diſcourſes that produced hopes and feares, untill within three houres of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he againe returned into the Princeſſe Chamber, with a reprieve for the old mans life, ſigned by the hands of the Senate; though with this condition, that ſhe muſt be pleaſed to follow the direction of the whole Kingdome in her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, however <hi>Caſſianus</hi> vowed by the heavens, he imployed all his power to have procured it abſolute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cloria</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe was not well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the reſtriction, yet ſhe was pleaſed with the pardon, and preſently ſent it by <hi>Roxana</hi> to the officers that had the cuſtody of the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> whilſt in the meane time ſhe conceived ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled ſatisfaction was neceſſary, that he might continue ſtill his begun courteſies to the aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; withall to poſſeſſe him with the knowledge of the impoſſibilities that hindred the progreſſe of his love, whereby he might be leſſe violent in preſſing the Senate to the accompliſhment of his deſires; and the rather ſhe fell upon this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> abſence ſecured him from all danger by underhand practiſes, though her ſelfe could not be confident of his ſafety, ſince ſhe had heard nothing from him; which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the preſent drew from her faire eyes ſome teares before ſhe uſed theſe wordes to <hi>Caſſtanus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Worthy Couſin ſaid ſhe, (for ſo I will now call you, ſince I finde your words reall, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169951:37"/>of being your wife, I ſhould a great deale ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, declare my ſelfe perſwaded to the choyce by your owne vertues, then by the Senates wiſedome, ſince the intereſt of a kingdome is not to be put in the ballance with the unity of affection; the one proceeding onely from forced reaſons, that laſt no longer then the motives have power by the operation of private ends, when the other ariſing from the ſecret influence of the heavens, engraves a perpetuall affection in the heart, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by humane Tyranny. Wherefore I ſay, intereſts of Crownes cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptialls, however ſometimes they pretend falſe ſhewes to cover hidden diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and ſo by that meanes conzens the world into a beliefe of what the married couple never enjoy, of the contrary enduring millions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed torments, that are increaſed in violence when they burſt forth like impriſoned flames, which by accidents procure their owne liberty: Therefore I ſay, nay I will boldly profeſſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the puniſhment of a thouſand deaths, before I be ever compelled to marry by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of earthly reſpects, much leſſe be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take any for my husband, that hath not really perſwaded my judgement, or abſolutely wrought upon my fancy; let it ſuffice your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections carry with them more powerfullneſſe in my conſideration, then the Senates deſires doe waight in my underſtanding, though I ſhould be ſorry to chuſe raſhly, or to be guided wholly by mine owne opinions; which is enough to let you ſee my unconquered, and I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169951:37"/>hope pure love cannot be conſtrained, although my deare life pay the ranſome of my ſeeming wilfulneſſe: for though Tyranny may ſhut up my weake body within ſtrong Walles, untill the juſt gods puniſh the wickedneſſe, yet my reſolved ſoul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occaſion ſhall be preſented; ſo that as your actions have changed already my beliefe of your intentions; doe not againe change your actions, that I become of an other minde, wherein you will but loſe honour inſtead of gaining love; and that loſſe perhaps may make you uncapable of all other fortunes; it is enough, I valew your bloud, I eſteem your perſon, and love your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; however I cannot be yours in poſſeſſion as long as <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lives; and with thoſe words wept againe, as at her former apprehenſions of his ſafety, which continued her in a ſilence, untill <hi>Caſſianus</hi> reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon:</p>
            <p>Madam ſaid he, as I cannot but be perſwaded, though unwillingly by your powerfull and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rhetoricke, yet give me leave to tell you, that I underſtand not your concluſion, ſince you have beene pleaſed to ſay in your diſcourſe, that as long as <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lives you cannot be mine; a choyce I muſt confeſſe, that the gods have never to this houre revealed unto me, ſince at my lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Lydia,</hi> a match of a farre greater dignity in Titles, ſeemed to be the obſtacle that deſtroyed my hopes, and ſo conſequently all motions I could make of my ſecret love: but however, if my ears have not much deceived my knowledge, I have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169951:38"/>heard it generally reported, that ſome accident many moneths ſince hath deprived <hi>Narciſſus</hi> not onely of the ſhare you pretend he hath in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but alſo of all the claime he can expect in this world. If it have ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> your pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the neerer; and with that fell a weeping again ſo bitterly that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> could not chuſe but accompany her in her griefe; but after ſome time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into conſideration both of the Princeſſes words and of his owne concernment, ſcarce yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reaſon to claime the intereſt of another; yet if <hi>Narciſſus</hi> were dead, he hoped his love and ſervice ſhould expect the next place in her affection: and with that parted from her, with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the intelligence, which afforded the Princeſſe a kinde of a calme for the preſent, that contented her thoughts.</p>
            <p>And this calm having made her diſcontents ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tolerable, ſhe was perſwaded one afternoon by her Governeſs, to take ſome little delight or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her impriſonment, that uſually was not frequented by ſtrangers, where a River in the midſt divided the field by a ſeeming equall arbitration; which afforded a kind of a ſad entertainment to the Princeſſe, whilſt <hi>Roxana</hi> was perſwaded alſo by her many ſolicitous thoughts, to ſearch out ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary walkes in the neighbouring woods, for the exerciſe of her contemplation: To this purpoſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſitting down by the Brook ſide, ſupporting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169951:38"/>in the interim her faire cheeks by her white hand, whilſt her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had created, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a moſt noble building, her fancy was carried as it were with a ſtedfaſt melancholly to behold the running ſtreame, that repreſented to her troubled imagination, her own inconſtant fate, that had formerly afforded her ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of happineſſe, in the converſation of her deare <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> whom now ſhe was not ſure ever to enjoy againe, which by a quick courſe ſeemed to haſten to the Sea to be drowned in that vaſt confuſion, as her paſt delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as ſhe was ſending alſo her teares along with the courſe of the River into the man Ocean, to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the multitude of thoſe rude waters, of a ſudden ſhe ſaw a Pilgrim to travers the Meadow, as if his ignorance in thoſe parts had rendred him altogether unskilfull in the wayes: But the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe being yet fuller of charity then ſorrow, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced for the preſent with her griefe, to give him ſome inſtruction; and to that purpoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to her, began to queſtion with him about his name and buſineſſe: The Pilgrim in a kind of amazed reply told her, that as his name ſcarce deſerved any remembrance amongſt thoſe that enjoyed happy conditions, by reaſon of his many misfortunes, ſo for his buſineſſe, he ſhould be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the eares of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> to whom it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, whoſe aboad as he was informed was not farre off that place. Truly anſwered the Princeſſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169951:39"/>if you meane that happy condition by my ſelfe, you are as much miſtaken in your opinion as you were in your way; however perhaps I may prove ſo fortunate to your intention, as to helpe you to the ſpeech of that Lady you mention, although I muſt tell you, this paſſage is not open to all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, being onely kept for the Princeſſe private recreation, and ſuch company as are confined with her in the Caſtle: At which words the poor Pilgrim fell upon his knees to aske pardon for his fault, though he proteſted he was altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that any prohibition, had forwarned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into thoſe private walkes reſerved for the Princeſſe pleaſure; however his journey into <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> was chiefly intended to her preſence. The Princeſſe quickly commanded him to riſe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that as the limitation of thoſe fields did not belong wholly to her juriſdiction, ſhe being her ſelfe a priſoner alſo under authority, ſo if ſhe were an abſolute commandreſſe (as he did imagine) ſhe was ſo well acquainted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to his ſacred habit, that his free abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would ſoone have been procured at her hands. At which words the Pilgrim began to weep, and notwithſtanding her earneſt intreaty, would by no meanes riſe from the ground where he kneeled, which made <hi>Cloria</hi> wonder, though not more at the buſineſſe then at his paſſionate carriage. Wherefore, after ſome few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his ſetled humility, ſhe told him ſhe was the Lady to whom the intention of his travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169951:39"/>received this information, he beſeeched her a new to pardon his rude errour, ſince as he ſaid, being lately come out of <hi>Syria,</hi> he could not be enformed of the dignity of her perſon, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any attendants about her to inſtruct his knowledge; and then wept againe as if his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had been nothing elſe, but meer expreſſions of ſorrow; untill at laſt having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchiefe hanging at his girdle, he entertained the Princeſſe with this language:</p>
            <p>Moſt vertuous Princeſſe ſaid he, be pleaſed to know, that it was my fortune to be in the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> when young <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was brought into the Towne mortally wounded by a ſhip of the ſame Towne, where by the courteſie of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he was ſoon provided of convenient lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings for his repoſe, and an aſſembly deſired of the beſt Phyſicians of the place for his cure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his name and condition was concealed from all but thoſe that had conveyed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thus hee remained with ſome hopes but more doubts for many weekes of his recovery, untill at laſt a dangerous Feavour made every one in the houſe deſpaire of his ſafety: amongſt which number it was my chance to be preparing my ſelfe for a voyage to <hi>Delphos,</hi> according to a ſerious vow I had made to the Gods for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of certaine offences. But he underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my intention, and conceiving my beſt way would be to paſſe by the Kingdome of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> in the journey, one day when the violence of his ſickneſſe gave him ſome more eaſe, then accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, &amp; that the chamber by hazard was freed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169951:40"/>from all company but my ſelf, by reaſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain holy day neere the Towne, he deſired me to approach his bed-ſide, where after I was ſeated, and that by many ſighes, he had made me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your unfortunate loves and his own condition, he conjured me by all the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ought to accompany my thoughts in ſo ſacred a journey, that in my paſſage I would viſit you in <hi>Lydia,</hi> where he underſtood you were newly arrived: and not onely declare unto you all the circumſtances of his untimely death, with the aſſurance of his moſt conſtant love to his laſt end; but withall obliged me to deliver this Ring which he ſaid was the deare teſtimony of the contract that had been between you; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly putting his hand in his boſome drew out a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wherein was contained that unwelcome token.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cloria</hi> beheld the pledge of their unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate loves now ended in the worſt of periods, ſhe looked upon it as if ſhe expected a miraculous remedy, or a miſerable diſtraction; till at laſt conquered by the very depth of her deſperate imagination, ſhe became exceeding pale, and ſcarce was ſo for any time before a more earthly colour, by little and little ſeemed to change that yet lovely white, which death it ſelfe a great while had no power to overcome. But alaſſe the proceſſion was too wilfull, for not long after her dainty, though weake legs not being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the waight of her faire body, ſince her pure ſoule could contribute no aſſiſtance, ſhe ſunke downe to the ground, like a rich marble ſtatue built upon ſnowy baſes: which cauſed the poor
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169951:40"/>Pilgrim with a haſte, compoſed of an amazed ſorrow, and a deſperate feare, to flye to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, curſing not onely his relation, but his very journey that occaſioned it: his violent execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not power to breath the leaſt ſhew of life into her ſweet body, as if the gods were reſolved to keep poſſeſſion of ſo heavenly a ſpirit (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he continued the rubbing of her Temples with more then ordinary paſſion) untill he ſpake in her eares, that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was not dead, but falſly ſo alleadged by his malicious &amp; wicked tongue; and for a teſtimony of his laſt affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which he wiſht might be confirmed by his perpetuall torment, as a puniſhment for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) he ſudden pulled off that deceitfull beard, that had ſo unluckily diſguiſed his perſon from her knowledge. <hi>Cloria</hi> after ſhe had for ſome time continued in her ſad ſleep, that faine would gently have ſent her without noyſe to a better ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, ſhe ſoftly againe opened her eyes, that ſeemed ſomething ecclipſed of their former brightneſſe, and fixing them upon that object that onely had power to keep them from entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an eternall darkneſſe, ſhe uſed theſe low words: And is it poſſible that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſtill lives? or is it my flattering fancy that ever couzens me into new miſeries? then ſhut them againe, as if either yet ſhe was not abſolutely perſwaded of his truth, or had a mind to reprove him for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde concealing of himſelfe; But <hi>Roxana's</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, both afforded <hi>Cloria</hi> more remedy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a meanes to beg <hi>Narciſſus</hi> pardon, who was not able by any Rhetorick to excuſe the ſin, he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169951:41"/>had committed againſt the Lawes of love, in bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing a diſguiſed ſhape, to hide that which <hi>Cloria</hi> had onely a deſire to ſee: however lovers quarrels although they are violent, yet never or very ſeldome are laſting; beſide the ſweet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe had no room left in her boſome for revenge, where there was already inſpired ſo much joy; ſo that in a ſhort time a perfect truce was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made between them, though chiefly expreſt in contemplation, wherein their hearts ſpake more then their lips: but after they ſeemed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ſurfeited of their joy, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was perſwaded to make a perfect relation of his own adventures: Wherefore, taking her faire hand, and gently kiſſing it twice or thrice, as a ſworne teſtimony of the truth of his ſtory, he began in this manner, whilſt in the meane time the poore Princeſſe read a lecture in his looks, that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amply to inſtruct her thoughts.</p>
            <p>Moſt ſweet Princeſſe ſaid he, as I know not what accident, or rather I may call it a fate, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated our ſhips one from another comming from <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo no ſooner were we out of ſight of your veſſell, but the winds, as if they intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to remember us of a meeting, though they ſeemed to deny the opportunity, began moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to rage upon the waters; in ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſt from one billow to another, with a kinde of a rude uncertainty, we became at laſt in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſperate of our own ſafeties: but then O you gods, how were my thoughts tranſported in your behalfe, knowing you to be in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of danger and hazard? how many lives would
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169951:41"/>I have willingly ſacrificed of my own, with what torments ſoever, but to have rendred you ſecure in my own thoughts, in ſome Haven or Harbour of quietneſſe, free from the inconſtant cruelty of the winds; and raging tempeſt that appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious to all our wiſhes? what infinite dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages did I conceive the whole world would ſuſtaine by your loſſe, ſince with you went away all vertue, honour, and beauty from the face of the earth? ſometimes I would call the Marriners from their neceſſary imployments, to aske their opinions concerning your danger and condition, whilſt they barbarous and ignorant wretches, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minded their own preſent affaires, then gave me any ſatisfactory reply, as if they underſtood not the conſequence of my demand, but rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly preferred their own ſafety, before thoſe thoughts appertaining to your particular: which cauſed me equally to beſtow both curſes and prayers in your behalfe: The Princeſſe finding <hi>Narciſſus</hi> in ſome ſort tranſported with theſe imaginations, whereby probably ſhe ſhould be delayed from hearing the ſtory of his adventures, with a pretty kinde of jeering ſmile, wiſht him to leave off now any more care for her particular, ſince as ſhe ſaid he found her ſafe, and rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that relation ſhe expected from him, as a more neceſſary duty for the preſent; This made him quickly fall to his taske with fewer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances then formerly in this manner:</p>
            <p>A night and a day ſaid he, having kept us upon the Seas in this ſtorme, at laſt the skye cleared it ſelfe from its cloudy incumberance, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169951:42"/>made us perceive, that we were neare the Iſland of of <hi>Rhodes:</hi> wherefore finding our ſhip was much beaten with the Tempeſt, and moſt of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany unable to undergoe a farther journey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome refreſhment, I gave my conſent to have the veſſell put into the Haven, the rather becauſe I hoped to heare ſome news of your ſafety in that City. The chiefe commander of that Iſland for the preſent is a great noble man of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who however he keeps a certaine correſpondency with the Senate for his own more convenient ſecurity, yet in his heart he is an entire ſervant to the King your Father, which not onely made me think my welcome ſo much the better in his Country; but his wife being my moſt neare kinſwoman, I was perſwaded to make my aboad for ſome few dayes in that place, whilſt in the interim we ſent out many ſmall veſſels, to enquire after your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but however I could have been very well content, to have remained there longer, in regard of the vertuous and noble entertainment both of the Lord and Lady, yet upon the meſſengers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne finding no advertizement could be given concerning your particular, with a certain kinde of melancholly rage I retired into my chamber, where I continued notwithſtanding any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary, untill another ſhip was fitted for our transportation, in regard ours was held for the preſent altogether uncapable of another voyage, without a great deale of mending and reparation: within two or three dayes I took my leave of my kinſwoman, and her Lord; though the gods knew in a very blunt manner, (my
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169951:42"/>thoughts being over burthened for complements) and preſently directed my courſe to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where I hoped you were; or at leaſtwiſe by my comming thither would be arrived; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I could not in my fearfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion but doubt the worſt, notwithſtanding thoſe in the ſhip, endeavoured by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to confirme me in a certain belief of your ſafety, which made the journey ſomething leſſe tedious and diſtaſtfull: I conjured the whole company entirely to conceale my name, from any perſon whatſoever untill you were found: when we landed at <hi>Salamine</hi> I underſtood the Queene your mother and my father were both lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence to <hi>Paphos,</hi> where again ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news whatſoever either of your aboad or ſafety, after I had ſpent ſome time in tearing my haire, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other fruitleſſe complaints, I reſolved in a diſguiſe to ſeek you out in the country of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia;</hi> whither very probably I conceited the winds and the ſtorm might have driven your ſhip, and by that meanes have committed your perſon to a new impriſonment, ſince that Territory is known to belong unto the King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> To this purpoſe having changed my habit (being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied by a few of my attendants I could beſt truſt) we put <hi>Egyptian</hi> colours upon the top of our veſſel, as if we had onely belonged to the principality of <hi>Pamphylia:</hi> thus we ſailed with all poſſible ſpeed towards the confines of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> in regard we underſtand by certaine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Syria</hi> remaining in <hi>Salamine,</hi> no newes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169951:43"/>had been heard of you in that Kingdome, ſince your departure from the City of <hi>Memphis:</hi> but the gods perhaps intending by this diverſion, to bring about other purpoſes according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and inſcrutable decrees, before we approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſhore of <hi>Pamphylia</hi> by ſome howers ſail, we were ſuddenly ſet upon by two veſſels of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and preſently commanded to yield our perſons to their power and diſpoſe, without diſpute or contradiction, unleſſe we would hazzard our ſelves in a contention moſt dangerous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. This language meeting my diſcontents and deſpaire, cauſed me to make a greater reſiſtance, then was either convenient or neceſſary for our welfare, untill at laſt being wounded in many parss of my body, and not a few of the company ſlain or hurt, our ſhip was not onely ſeiſed upon, but my ſelfe carried to the Caſtle of the Town, where an Officer belonging to <hi>Philos</hi> commanded me to cuſtody, for that <hi>Philos</hi> was for the preſent gone to <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> within three daies <hi>Philos</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Court, and not long after comming into my chamber, he quickly knew who I was: ſo beſtowing upon me ſome few complements (I deſiring him in the interim to conceale my name and qualisy) he preſently gave order, for my reſpectfull attendance and neceſſary cure: alſo he appointed me to be removed to the beſt lodgings in his Caſtle, with a promiſe abſolutely not to diſcover my perſon to any, but his own ſiſter <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> who, as he ſaid to his knowledge, would contribute her beſt aſſiſtance to my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: in this condition (though extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169951:43"/>inwardly by reaſon of your ſelfe) I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for at leaſt a weeks ſpace; when againe one day <hi>Philos</hi> came and feated himſelfe by my bed ſide, telling me after ſome few complements, that as his ſiſter had provided ſuch rare ſimples for the practiſe of my Phyſitians, as could not otherwiſe be procured, by all the power and art of the great and rich Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſo was ſhe reſolved ſhortly in perſon to give me a viſit, if not daily accompany me in my diſtempers, when I ſhould be rendred as he ſaid more proper for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ladies: then he made me exactly tell him the ſtory or manner of our unfortunate ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at ſea; ſeeming extraordinary inquiſitive, as well in what poſture I left you at parting, as what my opinion was concerning your ſafety: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this relation with ſo many particulars, brought to my remembrance by the diſcourſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my torments, like ſo many ſharp daggers piercing my heart, with a thouſand mortall wounds, yet I could not well deny the civillity, in regard that I was not onely in the Country of <hi>Syria,</hi> where I knew it would have been held a kind of a rude barbariſme in converſation, not to comply in all diſcourſes whatſoever, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any diſcontent or paſſion, but that for the preſent, I ſeemed to be alſo entertained with the beſt expreſſions of love and kindneſſe, could be imagined in his houſe: after I had made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what he could poſſible require at my hands in that nature, I both deſired and conjured him to ſend ſpeedily, what ſhips he could ſpare out of his Harbours, to enquire after your welfare and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169951:44"/>which being promiſed (ſome of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians at the ſame time comming into the room) he neceſſarily left me to their diſpoſe and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>As I began to recover my health, I became eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more then other perſwaded, and ſatisfied concerning the certaine hopes of your ſafety, in regard we cold not heare of any ſhipwracks, that had hapned upon any of thoſe coaſts, or ſeas neer <hi>Syria, Pamphylia,</hi> or <hi>Cyprus,</hi> how diligent ſoever the meſſengers had beene in their enquiry: which in a ſhort time ſo mended my condition, if not repaired my diſability, that oftentimes I was not only able, but preſcribed to walk into the garden, and other places of pleaſure for my better recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this was an occaſion, that one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I was ſent for by the Lady <hi>Artemeſia</hi> (<hi>Philos</hi> being for the preſent ſomewhere out of the way, attending upon his neceſſary occaſions) at my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall I found the Lady her ſelfe ſeated at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the room with a Sampler in her hand, and a waiting woman attending by her, that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her with thoſe ſilks ſhe had occaſion to uſe; however at my approach ſhe roſe up, to give me a reſpectfull ſalutation, and that drew from me ſome complements in regard of the dainty work ſhe had deſigned, which in truth appeared excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to my apprehenſion, being only the pretty banquet of the gods, where <hi>Juno</hi> ſweld with over much jealouſie becauſe <hi>Ganymed</hi> was ſo neer her husband: but that which pleaſed moſt my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was to ſee the angry lookes of <hi>Cupid,</hi> becauſe his mother courted her deformed <hi>Vulcan</hi> in ſuch
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169951:44"/>an aſſembly, whilſt <hi>Mars</hi> appeared to be out of countenance at the action. After I had not only viewed but commended the artificiall hand, that had ſo lively deſcribed the delightfull ſtory, <hi>Artemeſia</hi> made me this reply; that it was no wonder if humane creatures were given ſo much to love, when the very gods themſelves were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thoſe paſſions. Truly Madam ſaid I, although I cannot but allow of the paſſion, when it is ordained to produce onely noble effects, yet certainly the gods could never be ſubject to thoſe imperfections, when for the moſt part their flames were unlawfull, as either preventing of other mens loves, or deſtroying the chaſtity of virgines, as the Poets mention: for my part ſaid ſhe, I am of opinion, although moſt of their actions deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the wandring fancies of Poets, were but meer fictions, yet it cannot be but the ſtories of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> both ſons to <hi>Iupiter</hi> were true, and conſequently doe ſhew to our example, the lawfulneſſe of the paſſion, when ſuch <hi>Heros</hi> were produced: the one of a married wife, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a maid, to free the world from oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and injury, ſince they appeared buſied in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployment; who for their excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and juſtice, have been ſince eſteemed gods. This diſcourſe I muſt confeſſe comming from a virgin, did ſomething amaze me, yet we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our diſputation untill the time of the day, and <hi>Philos</hi> comming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a ſubject I as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in as her ſelfe. At which expreſſion the ſweet Princeſſe ſmiled, as if ſome cauſe had been
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169951:45"/>given her of jealouſie, however ſhe told him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſtory began to be ſuſpitious, yet ſhe had ſo much juſtice in her reſolution, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the end of his diſcourſe, hoping that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at laſt would cleere all difficulties: but by my honeſty Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be ſure he will never accuſe himſelfe what fault ſoever he hath committed privately; which words proceeded ſo ſharply from the old womans delivery, that it might be eaſily conjectured, that in her youth ſhe had been ſometimes couzened in her love; or at leaſtwiſe was of that opinion: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> bid <hi>Narciſſus</hi> go on, proteſting ſhe would not doe that wrong to her own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and noble thoughts, as to ſuſpect him whom ſhe had in her judgment eſteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration the poore Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſeemed to be tranſported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble thankes for the confidence ſhe had of his vertues, that became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by that opinion, he took her white hand againe, upon which he imprinted a multitude of vowes able to drive jealouſie out of the world, and then proceeded in this manner.</p>
            <p>But this interruption as I ſaid, not onely put off the exerciſing of my wit, and perhaps <hi>Arteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's</hi> intention, but alſo carried us all to ſupper, where many lookes of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my thoughts more then enough ſuſpition, and ſo conſequently my minde a great deale of trouble all the night following; untill the morning brought into my
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169951:45"/>chamber an old woman, whom I had often ſeene in thoſe viſits her miſtreſſe had beſtowed upon me in my fickneſſe, and boldly ſeating her ſelfe upon my bed, abruptly uſed theſe words:</p>
            <p>Of all the men in the world ſaid ſhe, I wonder at your ſtupidity, fince your youth and beauty ſhould be ſuch flames to love, rather to conſume your quiet reſt, then coldly thus to entertaine the more then offered affections of another <hi>Venus,</hi> whoſe perfections are only ſubjects of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is it poſſible that ſo bright a ſtarre as <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia,</hi> hath not a powerfull influence in your dull ſoule? When the earth ſeemes to tremble at the greatneſſe of her Uncle, which renders all people in a mauner willing to become his ſlaves, whilſt you appeare loath to be his friend. Can you thinke theſe frequent viſits that this faire and great Lady made to you in your ſickneſſe, and ſince her free converſation, proceed from ordinary reſpects, when the greateſt Princes in <hi>Aſia</hi> are not thought worthy of the favours without comming clothed with the pretenſions of being her husband; And alaſſe, who can be eſteemed ſo happy as to merit ſuch a Title, however far above you in dignity, though I could wiſh ſhe had choſen long agoe to have prevented her unhappy fate, by caſting her eyes and heart upon ſuch a ſubject: if you doe not yet underſtand this old Philoſophy, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe believe the new logick I deliver that am her nurſe, and conſequently ſhould know her mind. Let it ſuffice, if you liſt you may be happy beyond Kings; but if your perverſe fortune intend you not ſuch a bleſſing, certainly no leſſe a curſe then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169951:46"/>will accompany the diſaſter; ſince there is no meane to be expected, between poſſeſſion in love or ruine by hate; And after ſome time left me to be accompanied only by my own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſoon repreſented unto me theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. Firſt the dangerous conſequence of being in the cuſtody of <hi>Artemeſia's</hi> brother, who had the commodity as well to deſtroy as to ſpeak the word; and next the rage of the whole family if they ſhould conceive themſelves diſhonoured by the refuſall. Yet deare <hi>Cloria</hi> ſaid he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was ſufficient to reſiſt, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expreſſion, the Princeſſe only with another pretty ſmile, bid him go on in his ſtory; but the firſt ſaid he, moſt troubled my thoughts, ſince <hi>Philos</hi> love to his ſiſter as I believed, would eaſily be perſwaded by my death to make a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between our affections, when he ſhould finde my conſtancy could not be removed by his milder art, rather then hazard <hi>Artemoſia's</hi> honour; but for the ſecond, although I ſuppoſed the whole family would hold it for a ſupreame indignity, to have their kinſ-woman refuſed by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcovery of the Ladies paſſion: but I re-reſolved as my beſt defence, neither to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the old womans diſcourſe, nor of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes courtſhip, untill I were yet preſt by ſome new overture, not to be waved without a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory reply, and then to ſhew my courage in our loves; fince the Ladies paſſions, I ſuppoſed would not break out to any dangerous violence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169951:46"/>untill ſhe became abſolutely deſperate in her hopes. After I had dreſt my ſelfe, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my thoughts in a retiring place belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my lodging, I became ſuddenly invited by a meſſenger ſent by <hi>Philos,</hi> to accompany him to a certaine place belonging to his Uncle <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> not above foure houres voyage in a Coach; where the great favourite had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed abundance of wealth, with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, to render it an habitation both curious and ſtately, as being the place not only of his birth, but bearing the name of his family. The firſt object that preſented it ſelfe to our eyes, was a beautifull Towne, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the houſes, built in ſuch a juſt uniformity, that it became a queſtion to my imagination, whether the order or the materials ſhould have the greater preheminence in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſince the one in a pleaſant proſpective plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſight, as the other in a mature conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſatisfied the underſtanding: for as <hi>Cypres</hi> trees being mixt with the ſeverall buildings, afforded a moſt delightfull variety, ſo the richneſſe of the ſtone ſhewed it was deſigned to be laſting; both which being joyned together, the whole could not chuſe but be admirable, in ſo much as I had much adoe to get my lookes off thoſe rarities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till greater wonders appeared ready to entertaine me, which was the Palace it ſelfe ſeated in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient aſcent, built all of Tuſcan work, with ſuch exact skill, that the Architectures of the wonders of the world, might have been preſent at the deſigne: It was framed into a perfect ſquare,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169951:47"/>each angle ſupported by a goodly <hi>Pavilion,</hi> eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their guilded heads above the reſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, whilſt two Galleries of either ſide joyned by a portall of ſeverall coloured Marble, incloſed in a large Court that only at the further end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moyſayck work, and bounded by raile and baller of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Braſſe, where upon both ſides the ſtaires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on double pedeſtalls of <hi>Porphir,</hi> were placed the two ſtatues of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter:</hi> The outward Court round about the walls ſeemed to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Urrnes, mixt with halfe ſtatues of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grecians, whilſt the entrance being open at the top the architrave freeze and corniſh were cut off in the middle, and finiſhed with Cartooſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of meeting. The gate of either part was ſupported by <hi>Jonick</hi> pillars, two behind and one before, which made a returne in the building, and foure guilded Lions upon low pedeſtals ſeemed to guard the paſſage. After we had traverſed theſe beautifull incloſures, we were let into the gardens for the more conveniency of ſhade, ſince the day already began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curioſity were ordered into ſeverall diſcents, ſupported by huge Arches of white Marble, and in many places ſo covered with excellent Fruit trees, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a farre off, to be painted over with delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Landskips of woods, whilſt the Birds and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terworks incloſed in the vaults ſent forth a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing murmur to the aire. The firſt garden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were leſſe then all the reſt, becauſe it might afford a better proſpect upon the other,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169951:47"/>was divided into foure ſquares, each conteining a magnificent fountaine, the one having the brazen ſtatue of <hi>Hercules</hi> with his club in his hand, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned about with a Chriſtall lake, wherein were Fiſhes ſo gentle by education, that they waited in the water to be fed by thoſe that viewed the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities. The ſuperfice of the pond was formed into twelve angles, and raiſed three foot high by a certaine calle of cut ſtone, that reſembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labours artificially caſt in mettle. The ſecond water worke repreſented the naked figures of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and her Nymphes in white Marble; however ſo ſhadowed by a dainty grove planted by Art for that purpoſe, that their whole ſhapes could not perfectly be diſcovered, though there appeared enough for delight and admiration, whilſt poore <hi>Actaeon</hi> without the trees in a green plat of ground ſeemed to be torne in pieces by his own houndes, according to the judgement given againſt him by the revengefull goddeſs, though his friends in every place out of the buſhes, appeared to haſte to his reſcue. The third fountaine was only of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> with the tragicall event of their loves. And the laſt figured the fates of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> where her Tower being built in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other lake, which received its current from the firſt, made a kind of confuſed, though little Sea, wherein the compaſſionate Nymphes by exact expreſſions, were apprehended to bewaile the lovely Youths death, whilſt his diſtracted love, caſt her ſelfe from the battlements of her own lodgings, to accompany him in his buriall.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169951:48"/>But that which moſt delighted my ſenſes (becauſe it afforded a pleaſing proſpective between divers rowes of even ſet Trees) was a certaine banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houſe, built after the forme of a round Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with large windowes of bright glaſſe, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by guilded pillars, notwithſtanding it had a portall, to give it entrance, of many tranſparent columnes, or at leaſtwiſe they ſo appeared to my view at a diſtance; the materials that built it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with ſhells of mother of Pearle, ſo that the ſtructure reſembled a Tower of gold garniſhed with jewels; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheltred over head in every place but before, by united cypreſſes, it repreſented to my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a rich Tabernacle in a ſtately Pavillion; ſince the Trees were ſo tall, that they gave it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſhady luſtre, then a darke coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleaſant object, but that <hi>Philos</hi> invited me to a neerer taſte of the beauty, it being to be paſt over by a Bridge ſilver'd over, ſince the houſe it ſelfe was ſeated in an Iſland made by the winding courſe of a naturall River, though many artificiall ſtreames from it, ſeemed to contribute ſome aſſiſtance to the running Brooke.</p>
            <p>At our arrivall (having ſpent a quarter of an houres time in deſcending the ſeverall ſorts of ſtaires, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might encounter with our eyes, at the firſt opening of the doore, the Lady <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> newly come out of the water, ſcarce having covered her modeſty with a Lawne ſmock; neither did our ſurpriſall ſeem to haſten the accommodation of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169951:48"/>that light coverture to the beſt advantage, as if ſhe were ſo farre from being aſhamed to be taken in that poſture, that ſhe rather expreſt a deſire to have her beauties ſtill ſeen; her haire was at full length, though curiouſly curled, which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deſigne, and not to accident, ſince two waiting-women in Nymphs attire, held a great Looking-glaſſe before her, whilſt ſhe carefully dreſt her face with certaine black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and other ſmall creatures, for the better ornament of her lookes: her legs were bare, onely ſhe wore upon her feet a paire of rich embroydered pantobles: This, as neere as I can remember, was the ſtate we found her in. And very neere certainly you were, ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> that you could diſcover ſo much. At which words <hi>Narciſſus</hi> began to bluſh, proteſting alſo with a pretty violence; that he was ſo farre from liking her in that poſture, that he was as much diſpleaſed as aſhamed at her immodeſty. Well, well, replied the Princeſſe, goe on in your ſtory, without theſe impertinencies, ſince none laies any fault to your charge. Which command was too peremptory from his faire Miſtreſſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him in any longer diſputation; ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>But however, ſaid he, although ſhe put on no baſhfull amazement in her countenance, yet with a diſdainfull frown ſhe ſeemed to entertaine our company, which was a ſufficient injunction to cauſe us ſpeedily to retire; and that gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Philos</hi> (ſince we had already travelled enough over thoſe walkes) to command us to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169951:49"/>conducted up into the houſe, where we might be more conveniently ſhaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, where excellent pictures, not enough to be eſteemed, and rich cabbinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, untill a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we found <hi>Artemefia,</hi> ſcarce ſeeming to be the ſame woman we left her in the Garden; having not onely put off altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her choler, but alſo being trimmed up with ſo exquiſite a neatneſſe, as if ſhe had been prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her Nuptiall Feaſt; which confirmes my opinion, that all thoſe poſtures were deſigned of purpoſe, to make me think ſhe was admirable in every ſhape, as well when nature played the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wanton, as when art became the curious painter. Bvt in concluſion, a few complements ſet us all at table, where lovely pages like <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meds</hi> fill'd our Wine rather in Diamonds then Chriſtiall glaſſes, whilſt our fruit ſeemed to be fetcht from the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> all ſo excellent, that could not be imitated, much leſſe equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not ſay aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by raviſhing Muſick, both of voyces and Inſtruments, that with a gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burdened the eare; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued untill direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of all attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private converſation, a cuſtome in that Country for the better recreation, ſince they uſed not to remove preſently after dinner: however we all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169951:49"/>continued for ſome time in a perfect ſilence, they perhaps expecting what <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay of my noble entertainment, and their uncles greatneſſe; and <hi>I,</hi> not being over willing to adminiſter occaſion of diſcourſe, till at laſt <hi>Philos</hi> himſelfe brake out in this manner.</p>
            <p>Siſter, ſaid he, although <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe we have largely taſted of your bounty, though more of your neat curioſity, a property I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that better becomes youthfull Ladies; yet it ſhould ſeem before dinner, you were too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of your retiredneſſe, in ſuffering ſtrangers to be eye-witneſſes of thoſe beauties which you have deſigned onely for him that is to be your husband, as rich Jewels that are to be lockt up in cloſe Cabinets, not to be expoſed to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar view. Brother, anſwered <hi>Artemeſid,</hi> with a ſpightfull haſte, although it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, in that poſture to be ſurprized by your wandring intention; yet certainly I am leſſe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the accident, when I conſider you beheld nothing, that either I may be deprived of, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily can be equalled by other Ladies of my yeeres; onely all the feare I have is, leſt the ſcandall may prove offenſive to this worthy ſtranger, that I have ſo great ambition to content, that I ſhould beſhrew any occaſion that might render me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in his opinion, ſince the intereſt of my blood and converſation I know muſt alwaies keep me ſafe in yours:</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe this complement, or rather ſtrange expreſſion of <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> put me in ſome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169951:50"/>confuſion; conſidering of one ſide; if I gave her no anſwer at all, it might be interpreted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull rudeneſſe, having received ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite entertainment, pretended onely for my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, after my long ſickneſſe; and of the other part, what reply ſoever I could make, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from accuſtomed rules of civility, would of neceſſity engage my words to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of her perfections, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſome other paſſionate progreſſe of that love I ſo much diſliked: however, at laſt I fell upon this reſolution, to involve my anſwer into ſuch a riddle, that either could not be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or being ſo, it might imply a double ſence, which I delivered in this ſort: Madam, ſaid I, your beauties reſemble the innocency of the firſt Ages, that thought vertues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor imperfections to be mask'd by any art, whereby the rude multitude might alwaies have a book open, to learn know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and practice goodneſſe, which was the beſt way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written character for their inſtructions. This reply, although it did not for the preſent well ſatisfie, becauſe it ſeemed not to flame by the ſtroake of the flint, that had produced ſparkles, as they believed, to ſet on fire the youthfull Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my heart; yet of the other ſide, it left not an abſolute deſpaire in their opinions, that at laſt I might be warmed by their motions: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for that time the coldneſſe of my anſwer, changed the ſubject of our diſcourſe to other talke, that I confeſſe, I approved of; which with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169951:50"/>many varieties, continued us untill the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old habitation; where, at our arrivall, we found a Meſſenger newly come from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> attending to certifie <hi>Philos,</hi> that his great uncle <hi>Philoſtros</hi> was taken ſuddenly with a dangerous ſickneſſe, inſomuch as many of his Phyſicians very much doubted of his recovery; but however he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the news from all the houſe, yet the next morning very early, it cauſed him to take his journey, leaving me in the interim onely to be accompanied by his gallant ſiſter; who having the raines abſolutely in her own hands, let her paſſions runne with a full careere; for finding that all theſe trials had not wrought at all upon my affection, or got the leaſt ground of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſince the burning coales brought by <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> diligence from his mothers luxurious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, had not yet thaw'd my icy thoughts. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temeſia</hi> fell to work new ſtratagems, ſo that one morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly I ſpent ſome houres in the day, in conferring with thoſe books I moſt deſired to read, and viewing the Maps of ſeverall Countries for my recreation; of a ſudden I might heare the dolefull voyce of a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, divided from my knowledge by a partitian wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint: wherefore approaching neerer and leaning my head cloſe to the diviſion, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſtantly ſatisfied, that the noyſe proceeded from no other then from <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> which did
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169951:51"/>not a little increaſe my wonder, ſince I conceived her much beyond all misfortune: however I was reſolved to be fully inſtructed, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſetling my eares to an entire attentiveneſſe, in diſtinct words I heard this language.</p>
            <p>O unhappy <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible that thy owne beauty is of ſo poor a valew, that it hath not the power to attract the leaſt regard from a youthfull eye, which hath been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med heretofore, to inflame all the hearts of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi> or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the world, ſince a ſtranger in thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a priſoner contemnes both? O you gods of love and honour ſaid ſhe, permit not our family to be diſgraced though you be determined I ſhall periſh, ſince I cannot perſwade him I muſt hate my ſelfe; and by conſequence become a deſtroyer of us both; for as I am reſolved not to breath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer, ſo muſt not he live chiefely to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; with much other goodly ſtuffe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I leave to repeat, becauſe I will not prophane your moſt chaſte eares, with all the particulars of her violent and ridiculous paſſion; however I was forced to dwell with my conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon two points in her mad expreſſion; the firſt was, that ſhe ſeemed to declare me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, which untill then I never underſtood; though I muſt confeſſe, I found my liberty often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſtrained under the pretence of a loving care of my health: And the other that appeared more terrible, her ſeeming reſolution, either to enjoy or to deſtroy. Which made me when I had heard enough, to retire to my own chamber; but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169951:51"/>many dayes I had not continued there, before I perceived by the apparent neglect of the whole houſe, <hi>Artemeſia</hi> not ſending for me according to her cuſtome, that I was held for no other then a priſoner, being every night locked into my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by an officious Groom. All which was done as I underſtood to bring downe my proud and Icy heart, to comply with her deſires; her nurſe in the interim giving me many items of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; beſides, I might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious triumphes of my inſolent Miſtreſſe, when ſhee mounted her Chariot to take the aire for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, or performed ſome other viſits for her pleaſure. And that the ſplendor might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to my thoughts, as intended affronts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning my low condition &amp; captivity, ſhe cauſed an ordinary way to be made by my doore, where ſhe daily paſt with mirth in her countenance and ſcorn in her language; to ſhew ſhe had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot her old love, but the very remembrance I was in the houſe; whilſt in the meane time the foreſaid nurſe would now and then give me a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, as it were covertly out of pitty, to comfort up my thoughts againſt her Ladies rigour; however I very well knew her intention was but the better to diſcover my reſolutions; nevertheleſſe, with all which humours I was content to play, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void any further incumbrance of her Miſtreſſe offered affection, not doubting but at her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers returne I ſhould be able to procure my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſemtnt, the only happineſſe I aymed at, though my endeavours were not of force to prevent this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169951:52"/>following miſchiefe; for <hi>Artemeſia</hi> finding that no artifice could make me entertaine her love, or adore her perſon, ſince the heavens knew I had a brighter deity to worſhip, which kept me from all ſuperſtitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own revenge, and ſo reſolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore one day comming into my chamber, when I leaſt looked for her company, her own pride as I thought, having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a ſhort dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempeſt, ſaluted me with this deſperate language: Villain, ſaid ſhe, doſt thou think to carry the Trophies of my diſhonour into thy own Country, to adorne the chariot of thy Miſtreſſes triumphes, with thoſe ſpoyles thy diſdaine hath purchaſed in this Caſtle, to the diſgrace of our whole family? and with that ſtruck at my naked breaſt, being newly unbuttoned by reaſon of the heat of the weather, with ſuch a womans vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that I muſt confeſſe, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoyd the danger of the ſtroake, though not ſo much power as to hinder her rage; for finding I had not only defended my ſelfe againſt her intended and malicious fury, but endeavoured to become an abſolute conquerour over her mad paſſion, by ſtriving to diſpoſſeſſe her alſo of her weapon, with a ſpleen more infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall then humane, becauſe ſhe could not hurt me, ſhe reſolved to wound her ſelfe, whereby I might be eſteemed the greater criminall, to take off that blemiſh which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the ſtroake proved more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169951:52"/>deadly then perhaps ſhe imagined, for it not only pierced her arme, where ſhe onely intended it, but by reaſon of the ſharpneſſe of the point, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a great depth into her naked ſide, which with the effuſion of a great deale of bloud (that at laſt called up moſt part of the houſe to her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) left her dead in the view of all the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. This ſad diſaſter, as you may imagine, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inraged the whole company, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me either the actor, or the inſtrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a cloſer priſon in the Caſtle, whilſt according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of thoſe parts, my proceſſe was to be made the next morning by the Juſtice of the Towne, before the body could either be buried or imbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This accident gave my confuſed thoughts ſufficient imployment; however I made a great queſtion whether I ſhould confeſſe my name, or conceale my condition, finding by my citation, I was only called the ungratefull ſtranger, which gave me ſome opinion that my quality was not generally knowne in the City; believing as the one would not at all help to leſſen the crime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt me, but rather give the more ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a hidden deſigne, in that I durſt attempt a murther of that horrid nature, which an ordinary perſon would never have performed, ſo the other might in ſome ſort helpe to hide the ſhame to our Family, in being called to a publick defence in a caſe of ſuch a wickedneſſe: wherefore I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to reveale my ſelfe, untill ſome apparent neceſſity procured it.</p>
            <p>At my arraignment, there was alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169951:53"/>me beſides the breach of the rules of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, how that it was impoſſible any other could commit the murther, ſince <hi>Artemeſia</hi> was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not to be ſuppoſed ſhe had killed her ſelfe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I pretended that being a meer ſtranger in thoſe parts, it could not be imagined I ſhould harbour ſo much malice in my breaſt, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the murtherer of one that had treated me in my ſickneſſe with abundance of humanity; beſides I ſaid, the weapon which had given <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia</hi> her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own hand: but the buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to and fro violently diſputed, <hi>Arteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's</hi> nurſe was ſent for to give further teſtimony of my carriage towards her Miſtreſſe during my aboade in the Caſtle, which could not chuſe but give in the opinion of all there preſent, a great deale of light in the diſputation; however, the malicious old woman imagining her declarations might afforde me ſome aſſiſtance, refuſed to come, pretending ſhe was neceſſarily imployed in the Funerall of her dead Miſtreſſe, being locked up with the body in her private chamber; though the truth was, ſhe thirſted after my life to ſave the honour of <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> and the whole family, ſince by that meanes I ſhould not have the opportunity to divulge her prepoſterous love; ſo that at laſt I was not only found guilty, but condemned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to loſe my head within the Caſtle court; fearing belike in my laſt ſpeech I would publiſh ſome paſſages, that might render the people ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my innocency, and <hi>Artemeſia's</hi> laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169951:53"/>Thus finding all my honeſt Rhetorick, could not prevaile in my juſt defence to ſecure me from condemnation, I reſolved to declare my perſon, hoping that although it might not prove of ſufficient force to divert my judgement, yet nevertheleſſe it would be a motive to protract my execution untill <hi>Philos</hi> returned from <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> which declaration happily me with my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For after the Judges with much amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had entertained the knowledge of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being the ſon of him who was eſteemed ſo intimate a friend to the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> they not only preſently ſigned my reprieve, but conveyed me with all the reſpect their laws would give them leave, back againe to the priſon, where I remained untill <hi>Philos</hi> returne, who brought with him the newes of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> death and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, though foure dayes time was ſpent after his arrivall before he offered me a viſit, in which ſpace I had liberty enough for conſideration what would be my fate: At laſt he came and ſaluted me with this diſcourſe to my no ſmall adn i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>My Lord ſaid he, I muſt not onely deſire you to forget all your ill uſage in this Caſtle, but to interpret the reaſons, to have proceeded from a womans unruly paſſion (for I cannot give it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Title) without my privity, which my future actions, and my preſent diſcourſe ſhall teſtifie, if either you will believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleaſed then in ſhort to know, for my reſolution is to make unto you a particular confeſſion, and after commit my ſelfe unto you
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169951:54"/>goodneſſe and mercy, that when you and the faire Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> were at <hi>Memphis</hi> with <hi>Orſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> it was my fortune to be conquered by the power of love, proceeding not only from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of her beauty and converſation, but as I may ſay was thruſt upon me by ſuch a forcible and precipitate fate, that could not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the power of any reaſon or temper; in ſo much as I muſt tell you, in regard of thoſe paſſions, I could neither eate, ſleep, nor reſt with convenient ſatisfaction; ſo that I conceived my ſelfe obliged for my preſervation, to contrive a project with the <hi>Lydian</hi> Ambaſſadour then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Memphis,</hi> which was to interrupt your paſſage at Sea going into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whereby the better to make a ſeparation between your love, and that which the Princeſſe bore you, that both mine, and my ſiſter <hi>Artemeſias</hi> might ſucceed in the places: And however the gods prevented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the manner of the execution, then the effect of our deſignes, by contrary ſtormes and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents at Sea, yet I muſt now enforme you, that as your ſelfe by fortune were taken by our ſhips, which hath ſince produced this late diſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap concerning my ſiſter, ſo the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> by chance falling upon the Coaſts of the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> is now delivered into the poſſeſſion of the Senate of <hi>Lydia;</hi> and they as I am enformed, from thoſe Ambaſſadors of our Country that are at <hi>Sardis,</hi> intend with ſome violence to beſtow her in marriage upon her Conſin <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Prince of <hi>Iberia,</hi> whereby the better to fortifie their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Titles againſt King <hi>Euarchus</hi> her father;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169951:54"/>however they ſeemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they only intended her for my ſatisfaction, belike imagining that ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation would alwayes be ſufficient to continue our family faithfull to their purpoſes, and ſo conſequently make my Uncle <hi>Philoſtros</hi> ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imploy his power with <hi>Orſames</hi> for their advantages; but he being now dead (which newes they have already received in <hi>Lydia</hi>) they publickly diſclaime from having any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as believing now we can no more contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute profitably to their deſignes: wherefore as my thoughts and reſolutions intend a preſent retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome place of religion, to ſeek pardon of the gods for my many violent and unjuſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo did I very well know, their mercies in no kind were to be obtained, without ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar declaration of my own faults, which I have now made unto you: as I can no way doubt of your charity and compaſſion in my behalfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nobleneſſe of your nature; ſo may you be pleaſed to take what free liberty you pleaſe for your departure, with a promiſe alſo on my part to be ready to aſſiſt you with my beſt ſervices, either in your loves to the faireſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, or upon what other occaſion ſoever that may make you better honoured and eſteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I muſt confeſſe I was ſo well ſatisfied with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; not onely in regard of your ſafety, but alſo in reſpect of my own releaſement, that <hi>Philos</hi> imagined as I then thought by my preſent actions and expreſſion, that I meant to run away from him,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169951:55"/>for ſuddainly taking me by the hand, he ſaid he had a few more words to deliver unto me, that concerned his ſiſters proceedings, ſince he held it moſt neceſſary his own innocency might be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for that in no particular he proteſted, was he guilty of my laſt uſage.</p>
            <p>As I cannot deny ſaid he, but that I kindled the firſt ſparkles by my commendation of your perſon and worth, that afterward flamed ſo violently in my ſiſters boſome; ſo of the other ſide, I never expected it ſhould have broken out to ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous paſſion, whereby you were to be injured without meaſure, as my ſiſter deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond example: But as the Gods have their ſecret workings in all humane things, we muſt with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reverence ſubmit all our endeavours to their pleaſure, which will for the moſt part keep us from extravagant and wicked actions; ſince however ſometimes we might faile by miſpriſion, yet by a ſmall repentance we ſhould againe be brought into our accuſtomed temper, when as letting looſe the reines of our deſires without moderation, we are borne into a vaſt Sea of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that produceth nothing but prodigious deſtructions, as it fared with <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> who was reſolved becauſe ſhe could not obtaine ſuddenly what her own thoughts perhaps eſteemed lawfull, to convert that paſſion to ſo ſtrange a hate, that of neceſſity would not onely render the object of her wiſhes nothing, but her ſelfe miſerable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of ever being able to enjoy what ſhe ſo much longed for; however her old nurſes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, although they did not contribute to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169951:55"/>yet they produced thoſe projects that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your ill uſage; for finding you were not by any faire meanes to be wonne to my ſiſters deſires, ſhe adviſed her to aſſay the contrary, to try if that courſe could terrifie you to conſent: All which <hi>Artemeſia</hi> confeſſed before her death, her body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reviving after it was brought into her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chamber, as alſo with many Teares and fighes entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance might procure your charitable forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And with that taking me by the hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with terres in his eyes, he deſired me as a teſtimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchſafe the paines to viſit the dead Corpes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Funerals, which ſhortly were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Although I went with him as fully contented in my minde, as he ſeemed oppreſſed with ſorrow for his ſiſters death; yet I could not chuſe but have a noble compaſſion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, eſpecially for that the cauſe was only for over much loving me, but at my arrivall inſtead of imbracing the dead body, to my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful amazement, I was ſaluted with theſe words from living <hi>Artemeſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord ſaid ſhe, that you may not think you converſe with dead, (though changed) <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> you muſt firſt know, that after I had performed in your Lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own bloud, I was carried into my chamber, whilſt you unknowne to me was in danger to have ſuffered
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169951:56"/>unjuſtly for my fault: And being there by the carefull induſtry of mine own Phyſitian, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the privity of any, but ſuch as were intruſted about my perſon, I was not onely recovered from my trance, but before my brothers arrivall put out of danger of death; however, I deſired the buſineſſe might be kept ſecret from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all but my intimate ſervants, ſince I was reſolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not being willing to ſupport the ſhame of ſo deteſtable a fact: yet conſidering that an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of full ſatisfaction, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous with my own mouth, to make this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before I enter into the ſtrict rules of my pennance, by which I humbly and ſorrowfully beg your pardon, wiſhing a perpetuall proſperity to the chaſte loves between you and the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria.</hi> And this, my Lord, being all I have to ſay to you, I deſire you will have no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, then meerly what charity inſtructs your pious thoughts. And with theſe words ſhe drew cloſe the Curtaines of her bed, not willing to be ſeen, or any more ſpoken withall.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, I muſt confeſſe, rather appeared to my imagination viſions then actions, untill with as much honour as could be deviſed, I was ſet free by <hi>Philos,</hi> who alſo courteouſly offered to accompany me with his beſt ſervice in my journey; but becauſe I was reſolved to viſit the place of your aboad in a diſguize, not onely for that I knew you were in the cuſtody of your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169951:56"/>enemies; but alſo in that I had a deſire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the way, the ſecrets of the Senates inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning <hi>Caſſianus</hi> love, which I muſt confeſſe gave my thoughts ſome trouble, I refuſed his offer.</p>
            <p>As this diſcourſe ſeemed to give a ſingular content to the lovely Princeſſe, demonſtrated by many viſible ſignes, both in her eyes and bluſhes; ſo <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had all the while, with a moſt exact attentiveneſſe, given eare to his ſeverall relations, uttered this language, with a kind of a formall gravity: Truly my Lord, ſaid ſhe, you have not onely gallantly now cleared all our doubts and feares, but alſo in my opinion have carried your ſelfe in your difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a conſtant lover, which I muſt confeſſe deſerves both praiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall: and yet Governeſſe, ſaid the Princeſſe, we muſt not commend him overmuch, leſt he expect a greater reward then we ſhall be willing to afford him. Deare <hi>Cloria,</hi> replied <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> I cannot but confeſſe my own covetouſneſſe, ſince no leſſe a preſent can content my thoughts, then your admirable ſelfe, which is a Jewell beyond the price of the whole world: But ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> the chiefe property of Jewels, are to be looked upon at a diſtance; wherefore, if you will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied onely with that liberty and moderation, perhaps I ſhall without much difficulty grant your requeſt. Yet Madam, replied <hi>Roxana,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary he make choice of ſome other apparrell, better to become his perſon; ſo may you have both the conveniency now and then to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169951:57"/>meet in theſe walkes without ſuſpition, untill the confuſion now in the Kingdome afford you a greater liberty. But <hi>Narciſſus</hi> moſt earneſtly entreated to be entertained at a neerer diſtance; however without fruit, in regard both <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi> apprehended, that his paſſion to ſee <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſometimes received as a ſuitor, though but with appearing complements, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to ſome actions, which might either prejudice their liberties, or diſcover his perſon; for that neither of them could yet be over-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> intentions and fidelity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the old <hi>Flamin,</hi> although he had not ſince their late diſcourſe, either ſhewed any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſcontent, or ſo much as troubled them with viſits. <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> when he ſaw he could not by any means prevaile in his deſire, as if he had been at the inſtant poſſeſt with ſome Poeticall fury, began this complaint in verſe; which the Princeſſe, being excellent alſo in that faculty, as quickly anſwered <hi>extempore.</hi>

            <p>After the Princeſſe had thus perſwaded <hi>Narciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to be contented, finding the time of the day gave them no more opportunity, ſhe roſe up to returne to the Caſtle; however aſſuring him as often as ſhe could without danger to her ſelfe ſhe would frequent thoſe walkes for his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This being the decree all the favours poore

            <p>This ſudden intelligence gave <hi>Clorias</hi> thoughts ſome trouble, doubting a diſaſterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the Ideas of her chiefe delight, it ſeemed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her apprehenſion with a contrary feare, of being diſpoſſeſt of what ſhe had enjoyed by her flattering fancy; however ſhe called <hi>Roxana</hi> to accompany her in the expectation, commanding the little meſſenger not only to uſher in that ſtranger, that ſeemed ſo importunate, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himſelfe to wait in the outward roome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would have none privy to the buſineſſe, before ſhe and her Governeſſe were informed of the contents.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner did <hi>Cloria</hi> view this new intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but but ſhe knew him to be him whom ſhe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169951:59"/>moſt deſired to ſee, her young ſervant <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who had borrowed the habite of one of <hi>Apollos</hi> Prieſts, in a Temple where he lodged the night paſt amongſt the woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and her intruſted Governeſſe <hi>Roxana:</hi> nevertheleſſe the rigid old woman began to raile downe right at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, vowing with his too much paſſion he would deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all; this gave <hi>Cloria</hi> occaſion to laugh heartily, ſeeing her poor ſervant with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent looks, to undergoe the cholerick reproofe of <hi>Roxana,</hi> without replying one ſingle word to her haſty language, yet his patience not only by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little procured him his peace; but after a long conference with his compaſſionate Miſtreſſe, by the free conſent of her Governeſſe, who at laſt became perſwaded, he was entertained for a houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſervant; however the ſweet Princeſſe ſeemed unwilling to prophance his ſacred robes with any hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>But one day <hi>Caſſianus</hi> comming to viſit the Princeſſe, the gods know with what an envious jealouſie <hi>Narciſſus</hi> underwent this ceremonies; ſometimes he had a will to have interrupted his paſſage at the entrance into her chamber; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while againe he thought to have alleadged ſhe was aſleep, and could not be diſquieted in her reſt; and laſt of all he began to have a reſolution to quit his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldneſſe, in pretending in his preſence to his right: And a thouſand other fancies entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his imagination, almoſt in an inſtant, when there was no more time left him for theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169951:60"/>but whilſt <hi>Cloria</hi> was advertized of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> arrivall, and he admitted into her chamber; whither <hi>Narciſſus</hi> followed him with greedy ſteps to be a curious eye witneſſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: And when he ſaw <hi>Cloria</hi> with a gentle modeſty admit of her Couſins ſalutation, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing to give him any diſcontent, by reaſon of the old <hi>Flamine</hi> that was at his mercy, his colour began to change in his face; one while the beautifull red ſeemed to claime an intereſt in revenge, notwithſtanding all the prohibitions of his ſweet Miſtreſſe: then againe the faire white had the prerogative, and pretended feare to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> commands; ſo that in this manner they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left combating in his lovely countenance, untill he was rid of the occaſion of thoſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>Not many dayes after <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had performed his unwelcome viſit, the Senate belike jealous of the Princeſſe ſafety, in regard the King her father had been ſtrangely reſcued from their power by that Army that not long before they eſteemed their Subjects, ſuddenly commanded not onely thoſe ſervants to be removed from their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med attendance that had been about her perſon, but her ſelfe and <hi>Roxana</hi> to be conducted to a ſtronger Fort, there to remaine with better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and more honour as they pretended, until the preſent diſtractions of <hi>Lydia</hi> could in ſome ſort be pacified; in which number poor <hi>Narciſſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo preſcribed, which converted his paſt content into an unexpreſſible rage; ſome time blaming the heavens for not puniſhing the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169951:60"/>as he interpreted it, of the unjuſt and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons decree, then againe he abſolutely fell out with himſelfe, that he had not ability beyond humane force, to prevent the execution of ſuch a pernicious command. But alaſſe, his vaine paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ſo farre from defending the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> againſt that violence offered to her perſon, that he had not ſo much liberty as by one deare kiſſe to take leave of her white hand, amongſt the reſt of her traine, who were admitted to that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull honour: for the rigid guard finding by his diſtracted lookes, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in his breaſt, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply punctually with their ſtrict commiſſion, quickly diſcharged him from his ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, before they diſpoſed of the reſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This accident ſoon retired <hi>Narciſſus</hi> into the neighbouring woods, there to complaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Rocks and ſtones of the greatneſſe of the Princeſſe injury, and his owne misfortunes, in which place he remained in his wilde paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till want of food and lodging, conſtrained him to turne his thoughts to conſider his preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to that purpoſe reſolved to ſeek ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, where he might receive entertainement, untill he could further diſpoſe of his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince he found theſe fruitleſſe ſorrowes and diſtracted expreſſions, neither eaſed his griefe or profited his love. Wherefore after he had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three or foure dayes in the vaſt Forreſt, with ſuch proviſion only as he could get in poore and contemptible Cottages, as he paſt through a thick wood, which ſeemed to obſcure a certaine Plaine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169951:61"/>that lay beyond it, his melancholy eares of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were ſaluted with a certaine kind of rude muſick, that appeared alſo more confuſed, for that it was at many periods accompanied with the loud acclamations of common people. As this ſeemed a ſtrange adventure to his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after ſuch an abſolute ſilence for ſo many dayes in his ſolitary perambulation, where dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ecchoes appeared to have beene in a manner his only companions; with the uncouth fall of waters from high and unacceſſible precipices; ſo the unexpected newneſſe againe of probability of humane converſation, put on a little his deſire to be curious, though ſcarce was he willing to allow himſelfe any content at all, ſince ſhe that was the delight of his ſoule, had been forcibly ſeparated from his ſight; nevertheleſſe proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his intention, he directed his ſteps towards the place where he heard the noyſe, through the intangled Bryers, and almoſt impaſſable buſhes, which ſufficiently moderated his haſte, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his march, yet at laſt with much paine, he arrived neere the outſide of the wood, where he might perceive through the branches of the trees, in a ſpacious Plaine, a great many of Countrey people gathered about a little Altar, raiſed ſix ſteps above the ground; at which ſtood an old Prieſt offering ſacrifice to the god <hi>Pun,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his ſtatue placed upon certaine baſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of rough ſtone, and with more unpoliſhed workmanſhip. This diſcovery invited <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to attend the iſſue with ſilence, and the rather for that at every full point, and ſtop of the Prieſt in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169951:61"/>his devotions, the multitude ſuddenly took hands in a joyfull agreement one with another, and danced many rounds, about the Image in a rurall manner, to the only Muſicke of their untunable voyces, though a certaine ditty, which he could not underſtand by any words they uttered, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to expreſſe the intention of their mirth, though onely knowne to themſelves in reſpect of the rudeneſſe of the language, and the harſhneſſe of the delivery.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had a long time enterteined his wonder with the ſight of this extraordinary paſtime, deſiring alſo to ſatisfie his underſtanding of the reaſon of their aſſembly, he approached nearer the company, with an intention to enquire of ſome ſtanding by, not onely what the occaſion might be of that ſolemnity, but how he ſhould the readieſt way find out the next convenient Towne to give him reception; And the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity fitted well with his deſire; for the Prieſt having performed all the rights and ceremonies belonging to his office, was newly retired ſome diſtance from the multitude, to a ſmall riſing banke; as well to repoſe himſelfe, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with greater conveniency the continued ſport, wherein he ſeemed to have more then an ordinary intereſt, which made <hi>Narciſſus</hi> quickly addreſſe himſelfe to him with this courteous language.</p>
            <p>Father ſaid he, I hope it is the cuſtome in theſe parts, eſpecially amongſt thoſe of your profeſſion, not to take ill any curioſity of a ſtranger, that ſeekes civilly to be enformed as well in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169951:62"/>of the Countrey where he paſſeth, as of a convenient place that may give him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that I may prevent your demand which I make no doubt will ſeem neceſſary to your judgement, be pleaſed to know that I am by birth of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and intending a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the Temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> am by chance fallen into your company.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt ſeeing himſelfe ſaluted by a young man, though in his own habit of ſuch an excellent beauty, and ſo perfect a ſhape, preſently not only roſe up from his ſeat, to give him the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfull welcome, but told him for his lodging the night to come, ſince the time of the day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might prevent him of a better conveniency, he ſhould hold it an extraordinary honour, that his own poor habitation might performe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and the rather as he ſaid for that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſeemed to agree by the outward reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Robes. <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was not much diſpleaſed with the offer, as well becauſe he found himſelfe ſomething weary by reaſon of thoſe extravagant and uncertaine journeyes he had made, as alſo that he might hope by this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get further information concerning his own reſolutions, that yet he had not fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civill thankes for his favour, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation he was willing to accept of his charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindneſſe, they both ſate downe together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bankſide, to behold the finiſhing of thoſe rurall delights, that paſſionately ſeemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Countrey people, which gave occaſion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169951:62"/>to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to demand the reaſon of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mirth, that poſſeſſed the thoughts of the whole company. The Prieſt after he had a little ſmiled to thinke of the ſtrangers apprehenſion, told him, ſince he perceived his curioſity went ſo farre as to be ſatisfied in thoſe petty affaires, he would take the paines to let him know the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that produced the effects, which as he ſaid was the more proper for his entertainment; ſince the occaſion at the preſent detained almoſt all <hi>Aſia</hi> both in expectation and wonder; however he feared his ſtory might be too tedious for his patience. But <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſeeming rather paſſionate at the ſatisſaction then diſtaſted at the offer; the Prieſt retired ſomething further into the woods, to be more out of the noyſe of the people, where after he had ſetled the ſtrangers expectation to a ſilent attentiveneſſe, he began this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Sir ſaid he, you muſt be pleaſed to know that our King <hi>Euarchus</hi> grandmother called <hi>Minerva,</hi> (by whoſe right he came to weare all thoſe Crownes he was once poſſeſſor of, and might ſtill have enjoyed in a proſperous meaſure, if his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had been equall to his goodneſſe, or his Subjects loyaltie anſwerable to his own eminent worth) was a Princeſſe of ſuch excellent vertues, that it had been a controverſie between art and nature, whether had more bountifully contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the adorning of her royall perſon; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe only raigned in <hi>Myſia,</hi> a Country not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but luxurious in the unfaithfulneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though her birth juſtly claimed the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169951:63"/>of this rich Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> after our Queen then raigning here; I ſay this admirable Princeſſe had a baſe brother alſo, named <hi>Leonatus,</hi> who wanted not ambition enough to deſire the Crowne of <hi>Myſia,</hi> though he were not furniſhed with ſufficient vertues to merit ſuch a dignity; and to this purpoſe left nothing unattempted that might either advance his own eſteem or deprave his ſiſters actions; and to that end inſinnated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by all meanes poſſible, not only into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the common people; in which interim the young Princeſſe being furniſhed with youth and beauty, was perſwaded by the chiefe nobility to thinke of a noble husband that might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her in her converſation, and give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a hope of poſterity, two eſſentiall parts as they pretended of her own happineſſe; in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this deſire, there was preſented unto her view a handſome Lord of this our Countrey of <hi>Lydia:</hi> in concluſion the nuptials were quickly ſolemnized to the appearing content of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the rather for that the then Queene of <hi>Lydia</hi> was well ſatisfied with the choyce, not doubting to maintaine by this meanes a continual and ſtrong intereſt in the Kingdome of <hi>Myſia,</hi> ſince ſhe had married to the Princeſſe one of her own Subjects.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Leonatus</hi> began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a bar to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for ſucceſſion, he thought it his beſt way to eſtabliſh himſelfe notwithſtanding, a certain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the government, and to that purpoſe ſtrived
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169951:63"/>by all meanes his malicious will could inſtruct, to gaine the good opinion of the young King, whereby to ſet him at difference with the Queen, who began to be a little diſtaſted, to ſee his wife take upon her ſo abſolute authority, he only bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the name of a Prince; which at laſt grew to ſuch a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked <hi>Leonatus,</hi> that one day when the Queene (being great with child) was retired into her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chamber, to conferre with a certain Secretary of State, moſt imployed in the Kingdomes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, her husband of a ſudden ruſht into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his ſword drawne, and there before her amazed eyes ſlaughtered her poore ſervant. However this was an act of ſome horrour to the great bellied Queen, and ſo conſequently might be thought ſufficient motives of her laſting indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſee her ſelfe and authority ſo affronted by one ſhe had lately raiſed from being a Subject to be her husband; yet religion and good nature proved ſo powerfull in her noble diſpoſition, that upon the Kings ſorrow and ſubmiſſion, ſhe was content both to forgive the injury, and forget the diſhonour by a perfect reconciliation. But <hi>Leonatus</hi> not weary yet of his own wickedneſſe, though deſpairing of his further ability to retain his intereſt with the young King, ſince the Queen as he thought had ſo abſolutely circumvented him in that project, of a ſudden ſtroake into friendſhip with certaine factious Prieſts, that had newly brought in a religion into <hi>Myſia,</hi> that taught this dangerous Doctrine; <hi>That Princes deſerved no longer to governe, then whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169951:64"/>the People.</hi> Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly with the multitude, in ſo much as in a ſhort time the Queen had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough, to defend her perſon from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, as her Kingdome from civill warre; This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, untill the birth of her young ſonne againe revived her ſpirits: however <hi>Leonatus</hi> ſtill proſecuting his horrid deſignes to ſupplant the Queen in her juſt right, whereby to bring the government of the Kingdome under his own juriſdiction, one night ſecretly cauſed not only the young King to be cruelly murthered in his bed, in execution of his revenge, becauſe he had quitted his party, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo laid the bloudy ſlaughter, by way of private aſperſions, upon the innocent and religious Queen, the more to bring her in hatred with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who ſeemed already ſufficiently poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey by the turbulent Prieſts: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe crafty practiſes had not as yet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſhake, or rather abſolutely to deſtroy her grounded authority, which had been caſt upon her by ſo rightfull a ſucceſſion, yet by little and little they ſo wounded her reputation, that they made her deſire to have a faithfull companion, to aſſiſt her in her government; which politick <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> perceiving, judging it a love paſſion in the Queen, put on ſome of the nobility underhand to perſwade her, not only preſently to marry, but to take for her husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended unto her love, however he was not without ſome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169951:64"/>ſuſpition, that he had been an actor in the Kings death; with theſe baites I ſay <hi>Leonatus</hi> ſo farre intangled the Queenes innocency, that ſhe was wonne by perſwaſion to make this election, being councelled thereunto by the chiefe nobility, ſet upon her to that purpoſe, though ſhe firſt cauſed a decree to be paſt by the unanimous conſent of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the falſe aſperſion his enemies had caſt upon him, concerning the Kings murther. No ſooner were theſe nuptials ſolemnized, which was the thing <hi>Leonatus</hi> deſired, but ſecretly he admoniſhed the new King to flye, aſſuring him as his friend, that either he would be ſuddenly ſlaine by many that had conſpired his death, or publickly be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and brought to his Tryall by the conſent of the whole Kingdome; ſo that he, whether knowing himſelfe faulty indeed, or fearing the power and injuſtice of his enemies, ſince emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt his equalls had procured him a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately without the Queenes privity, quitted his Country and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonatus</hi> conceiving now he had compaſſed the hardeſt part of his projects, ſent ſecretly into <hi>Lydia</hi> to poſſeſſe the Queen there, with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Minerva's</hi> guilt, ſince ſhe had married the murtherer of her firſt husband; too apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he pretended, diſcovered by his ſtrange flight: at the ſame time alſo, by the help of his factious prieſts, he raiſed tumults againſt her, in her own kingdome, whereby ſhe became impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, becauſe ſhe would not quit her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169951:65"/>This you may believe, gave the poore Queen ſufficient imployment; inſomuch as being wearied by continuall troubles, and invited to the Court of <hi>Lydia</hi> by her kinſwomans promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for her better and quiet protection, ſhe was content to reſigne the Crown to her ſonne, and accept of thoſe offers ſhe eſteemed reall. But alas, no ſooner was ſhe arrived within the bounds of this kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but contrary to her expectation, wherefore amazed in the execution, inſtead of being admitted into the Queens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with love and honour, ſhe was commanded as a priſoner to a Caſtle not farre off; whilſt in the mean time her young ſonne was committed to the tuition of <hi>Leonatus</hi> her worſt enemy; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with this pretention, that as ſoon as ſhe could cleare her ſelfe of thoſe aſperſions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations that her ſubjects brought againſt her, ſhe ſhould enjoy thoſe reſpects at Court which had been largely promiſed her; though in the interim ſhe muſt be content with her fortune, ſince the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> thought it not fit for one in her condition, beſpotted with the opinion of ſo black a crime, ſhould have any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their Queen, as 'twas pretended, of ſo bright a vertue; when the gods know, it was either the too much cleerneſſe of her own good parts, or the rightfulneſſe of her title, being of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, that was the onely obſtacle of her happineſſe. But whilſt <hi>Minerua</hi> under-went for many yeeres a hard impriſonment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſince the Queen her ſelfe was ſo farre from eaſing her of her bonds, as ſhe would never give eare
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169951:65"/>to her complaints; the King her young ſonne began to approach to mans eſtate, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureneſſe in age, gave him a feeling of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oppreſſions; but her enemies in <hi>Myſia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo backt from the States in theſe parts, who had an intention all they could to ſuppreſſe his greatneſſe, that he might have no power to claim his right in the kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> gave his thoughts and actions not onely continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions, but at laſt impriſoned his very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his own kingdome. Notwithſtanding all this, the wiſe King bore theſe inſolencies with unexampled patience, knowing that as it was not in his power to free himſelfe from their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny by any Kingly pretention; ſo of the other ſide he hoped that factions amongſt themſelves would at laſt purchaſe his liberty. In this ſtate he continued, untill his Guard found that it might be prejudiciall to his Titles in <hi>Lydia,</hi> after the old Queens death, to keep him thus as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, whereby they might alſo be debarred from a plentifull ſhare of the gain, when <hi>Lydia</hi> by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould fall to him; upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they of a ſudden, not onely releaſed him, from his confinement, but every one of theſe men themſelves ſtrived who might be moſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; when as he not onely as a good natured Prince, forgot all his injuries, but became ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pleaſed to be at liberty, upon any termes. But the old Queen of <hi>Lydia,</hi> drawing now to her laſt period, both of life and Kingdome; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it was reaſon ſufficient for a juſt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to have the heire apparant ſo neere her juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169951:66"/>whom ſhe imagined looked upon her continuance; like a young bloſſome, that ſtrived to thruſt out the ancient and withered flower from its ſtalke, began ſuddenly to queſtion the poore Princeſſe (her ſelfe alſo being almoſt worn out by her hard uſage) about her correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with thoſe forraine powers, who were of her kindred; And not content with any anſwer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to her triall before ordinary Commiſſioners. As theſe might be evident marks of <hi>Minerva's</hi> ruine, ſo were they not undiſcovered by the ſharp apprehenſion of the wiſe Lady, though her ſpightfull fate, would not afford her preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, notwithſtanding her excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet as ſhe had good cauſe, ſhe excepted againſt thoſe partiall Judges deſigned for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by all the pretentions that a free Prin ceſſe, or an oppreſt woman could alledge, though the Queen ſeemed as deafe to her juſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable requeſt, as her enemies were violently bent to ſatisfie their cruelties; untill in the end ſhe was forced to deſiſt from her importunities, and ſtick wholy to the confidence her goodneſſe had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited in God mercies. This not onely brought her to a judgement-ſeat, prepared with ſome outward circumſtances fit to entertaine her dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but to a condemnation prepared with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to bewitch the underſtanding of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who rather deſired to behold ſtrange ſpectacles, then to be delighted in juſt actions; and in this May-game, as I may call it, of the worſt cruelty, when the form of Law was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169951:66"/>onely made uſe of to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all her fortunes, ſentenced to loſe her head. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this condemnation, the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> for ſome time deferred the execution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her own honour could not but ſuffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes, her equals, as her kinſwoman in perſon did at home, under her juriſdiction. But ambition, jealouſie, and revenge, at laſt got the victory over all her other vertues, by the malicious and crafty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of <hi>Minerva's</hi> enemies; who believed, they could not be ſafe as long as ſhe lived; ſince it was probable, if ever ſhe came to weare the Crown of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſhe would alwaies be mindfull of their diſaffections; theſe reaſons procured the Queen underhand, to ſigne a warrant for <hi>Minerva's</hi> death, which by the Lawes of the Countrey could not elſe be taken away by any power; and with this authority a meſſenger preſently was ſent to the chief officer of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to give <hi>Minerva</hi> warning of her approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching doom. When the ſad Princeſſe beheld this bloudy character written with the royall hand of her neereſt kinſwoman, it was a queſtion whether amazement or courage governed moſt in her noble thoughts; for as of one ſide ſhe could ſcarce believe, that the Queen had been drawne to an act ſo prejudiciall to the honour of her Sex, ſo of the other ſide, ſhe entertained the newes with a gentle ſmile, as a wiſhed period of all her miſeries, onely with three or foure deep ſighes, ſhe deſired theſe requeſts of thoſe commiſſioners
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169951:67"/>that had authority to ſee the ſentence put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Firſt, that ſhe might have all her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about her at the time of her death, to beare true teſtimony to the world, that ſhe neither ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in her religion, nor derogated from her ſonnes honour: next that the Queen would be ſo charitable, as not onely quietly to ſuffer thoſe that attended about her perſon in ſafety to quit the Kingdome, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward them according to the juſt ſervice ſhe had received: and laſtly, that ſhe might have a Prieſt of her own profeſſion, to comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct her in her laſt ſuffering. To the firſt, they onely anſwered, that as they could not give her leave to have all her attendants about her for feare of tumults, by reaſon of their multitudes, ſo were they willing to allow her ſome few to ſatisfie her deſire. For the ſecond, they promiſed to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the Queen in her behalfe. But for the laſt, they abſolutely refuſed her requeſt, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it would be a diſhonour to the religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in <hi>Lydia.</hi> With theſe anſwers <hi>Minerva</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into her chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts againſt the next daies combate, where ſhe remained all that night with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a zeale to the worſhip of the gods, and ſo cheerfull a demeanor in the perſwading of her ſervants to patience, by contemning of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperity, that it was eaſily to be perceived, ſhe rather entertained death as a kind friend, that intended to put her in poſſeſſion of a better life, then as a fierce enemy that ſet before her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion frights of a horrid deſtruction; Thus ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169951:67"/>her imployment, untill the early morning, and watchfull cruelty brought to her chamber doore the inſtruments of her deſtruction: This warning was ſufficient to make her prepare with Majeſty, to act the laſt ſcene that ſhould render her famous to poſterity. Wherefore with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant look, as if ſhe intended to laugh at deathes worſt ſhape, when ſhe came out ſhe bid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold with all the circumſtances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with blacke Velvet; where being ſet in her diſmall Chaire of State, ſhe told the ſpectators, that as they muſt not expect many words from her, in regard her ſiſter the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> was not preſent, to whom ſhe would only have directed a diſcourſe; ſo of the other ſide, ſhe wiſht them all to beare witneſſe, that ſhe conſtantly expired in that religion ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſt to the world, for which ſhe both did, and was joyfull to ſhed her beſt bloud, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid, by one and one ſhe took leave of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who being over preſt with griefe and teares were ſcarce able to performe their laſt though conſtrained duties to fit their glorious Miſtreſſe for her execution; And with another ſweet ſmile holding up her white hands to the omnipotent gods for mercy, not long after without the leaſt unquiet motion, ſhe received that fatall ſtroake that ſent her ſoule to an eternall habitation.</p>
            <p>When this unexampled Tragedy became ſpread over <hi>Aſia,</hi> which gave ſufficient occaſion of large diſcourſes, it could not but with ſpeedier wings flye to her Sons Court, with all the particular
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169951:68"/>circumſtances of her death, where it reſted untill an Ambaſſador from the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> was ſent in ſome ſort to leſſen the fact, as being abſolutely done without her privity, as he pretended, to which purpoſe ſome of her principall Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors had been puniſhed: but this Balſame a long time had not power to heale the deep wound this apprehended cruelty had made in his dutifull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, untill his people finding that <hi>Myſſia</hi> was not able to contend with <hi>Lydia</hi> in any revenge, and that the ſmalleſt attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honour, might interrupt his quiet and peaceable ſucceſſion to a Crowne ſo rich and flouriſhing, which ere long he could not by courſe of nature but expect, ſince the Queene was both old and decayed, not only diſſwaded him from any hoſtile evaſion, but alſo counſelled him to entertaine a firme correſpondency with the State, he was to poſſeſſe; and the rather, for that the <hi>Lydian</hi> meſſenger threatned him with a legall deprivation from his royall right, by the conſent of the whole Kingdome, by whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he ſaid, his mother had been condemned, if any way he ſtirred violently to diſturbe the peace eſtabliſht in both Countries.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons I ſay render'd him as well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſhew as in effect, who was eſteemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly peaceable if not ſlothfull in his nature; which was the occaſion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions of glory, ſo did it make him for the moſt part as it were a captive, to the preſſing importunities of his covetous, and inſolent Country men the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:169951:68"/>who ſcarce would be ſatisfied with any gaine or preferment whatſoever he could beſtow upon them: But to be ſhort, at laſt the old Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> dying he without any contradiction, quickly took poſſeſſion of her Kingdoms, in which government he continued with all the proſperity in the world during his life; but that finiſhed, the Crownes of <hi>Lydia, Myſſia,</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a juſt right upon his hopefull Son and Succeſſor <hi>Euarchus,</hi> then newly married to <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthia, Orſames</hi> ſiſter, our now Queen, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed alſo thoſe poſſeſſions (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt needs ſay) with as much happineſſe (untill theſe laſt ſtirres) as it was poſſible for mortality to expect.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Myſſians</hi> who as I ſaid before received golden liberalities in the time of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when they found that <hi>Euarchus</hi> nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous iſſue, and the Queenes neceſſary expences did in a manner drowne all their expectation; firſt, began to mutter in words againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed vanities of the times; and laſtly they found fault that only ſmooth faced boys enjoyed, as they ſaid, all the credit of the Court, when Souldiers and men of valour wanted both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and meanes to live, the King being ſo bewitched to his own eaſe, and his wives content, that he could not be drawne to helpe his own brother in law, againſt the oppreſſion of the King of <hi>Armenia;</hi> by which warre many might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed that now wanted ſubſiſtance: nor was there wanting in <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe many factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that not only received encomagement by this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169951:69"/>bold language, who alſo coveted ſtate preferment in the government of the Common weale; yet theſe begun diſcontents lay hid in the cinders of ſome duty, untill new taxations of the Subjects gave more deſperate diſtaſtes; beſides, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall arrivall of Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in <hi>Lydia</hi> after his Fathers death, ſtirred up the pride of one <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoras</hi> to a new ſpleen againſt the King, by which means he believed he ſhould be the ſooner imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But that which ſeemed moſt to contribute to <hi>Euarchus</hi> prejudice, was the ſudden arrivall of an old <hi>Myſſion</hi> Captaine out of the warres of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> called <hi>Lycius,</hi> who having gained in thoſe ſervices good ſtore of wealth, ſued to the King to have himſelfe rewarded by Titles of honour; which being denyed him by ſome neglect, as alſo <hi>Caſſianus</hi> requeſt for a competent aſſiſtance, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle protracted, this inſolent Commander quickly flew from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and comming into his own Countrey omitted no diligence that could withdraw the people from their lawfull obedience, which he had the better opportunity to effect, ſince he found not only the nobility am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, but the Prieſts violent. The one he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded with brave ſpirits againe to looke upon the courage of their Anceſtors, who had by force of Armes torne priviledges from their King; the other he admoniſhed to caſt their thoughts upon the recovery of that religion now almoſt loſt, that had formerly chaced their former Queen both from her Kingdome and life; and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people it was ſufficient ro plead to their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169951:69"/>liberty; by whoſe perſwaſion the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not only raiſed a power abſolutely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Kings authority, in their own Country of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> but alſo led a great Army into <hi>Lydia,</hi> whereby to compell <hi>Euarchus</hi> to ſummon the great Councell of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, when this eminent aſſembly was met, as it was deſigned in the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which was alſo aſſured to be made a free Towne (as much as to ſay, as not to be compelled to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his poſterity) the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diſcourſes that were made there, were in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Kings actions, and almoſt all the Acts that paſt were to deſtroy his authority: All which the milde King ſuffered with a world of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hoping that time, after they had wearied themſelves with their violent paſſions, would let them ſee their own miſtakes, or the gods at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would defend his innocency: however theſe unexpected proceedings not only continued, but their rage grew to ſuch a height againſt his perſon whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the greater contempt amongſt the common people, that by divers tumults countenanced in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he was at laſt forced from the City of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> whilſt the Senate in the interim iuſtituted a ſtrong guard of Souldiers of the Towne Forces, to wait upon their Councels, becauſe they would ſhew to the Subjects, greater markes of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Aſſembly, then in the Kings dignity.</p>
            <p>But whilſt many were brewing their own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate deſignes with uncredible inſolency, being chiefly ſupported by the votes of the common
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169951:70"/>people, who were perſwaded they ſhould recover by their authority an abſolute liberty, the poore King with a very ſmall traine retired to the City of <hi>Theatyra:</hi> where however, contrary to the expectation of the Senate, who believed that their diſcountenance, was ſufficient to render him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by the whole Kingdome, he not onely received better welcome, but was entertained with the generall commiſeration of moſt of thoſe parts, who bitterly complained of his hard and as they thought unjuſt uſage; and the rather did this pitty prevaile for that by his eloquent and fluent Pen, he ſeemed fully to beat back all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions his enemies ſought daily to caſt upon him, which brought as I ſay to his Court multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of gentry and nobility, both from the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> and other parts, who vowed perpetuall faithfulneſſe to his perſon, with other eſſentiall ſervices.</p>
            <p>Theſe encouragements by the perſwaſion of his truſty Councellors, made him imploy his beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to raiſe Souldiers, whilſt in the interim he ſent to the Queen, whom he underſtood was in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to procure him Armes, by the credit ſhe had purchaſed with the Duke of that Country, ſince the Senate had already ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his Magazin and ſhips: After which he went from one Province to another, to feele the inclination of the people; yet as he found moſt of them for him in their words when he was amongſt them; whether out of the inconſtancy of their own natures, or unwilling to be at any charge to maintaine new troubles; as ſoone as he left them
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169951:70"/>perſonally, they were for the greateſt number car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from their former profeſſions, ſo that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſucceſſe of his whole fortunes, was chiefly to depend upon the gallantry of the better ſort. And truly this expectation did not deceive him; for in a ſhort ſpace, beyond all beliefe they ſo furniſhed him with moneys, beſides their own attendance; that he became maſter of a brave Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my commanded by his nephew Prince <hi>Thyaſmus,</hi> who was newly arrived in his Campe from the <hi>Armenian</hi> warres.</p>
            <p>The Senate, who before had raiſed Forces to contend againſt the Kings intentions, according to the intelligence they had received not to be ſloathfull in their affaires, quickly created <hi>Dimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> generall in the deſigne, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, by reaſon of the ſpightfulneſſe of his own violent ambition; no ſooner was he eſtabliſht in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to ſeparate the King from perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Councels, and bring him ſafe to <hi>Sardis,</hi> there to be better governed; to which purpoſe that City had plentifully furniſhed money, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their proſperity depended upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ruine.</p>
            <p>This reſolution was quickly knowne to <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and not long after conſidered by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that it was high time to advance with the whole Army, to try the fortune of a battell with the Senates Generall, ſince the King wanted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and could not expect ſupplies of money to furniſh out the neceſſary expence: with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169951:71"/>after two or three dayes march, they met the Senates forces upon an ample Plaine, ſpacious enough to have deſided the controverſie for the worlds Empire: the conflict of a ſudden grew ſo deſperate, that it was a queſtion whether they ſought more to ſatisfie their own ſpleenes, or to gaine a beneficiall Victory; which however was proſecuted for ſome houres with doubtfull fortune; for although the Kings horſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Thyaſnius</hi> in perſon, at the firſt charge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their enemies, in ſo much as for many Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, they had the chace of their Troops, yet the Foot Forces in their abſence, that for the moſt part wanted armes, had ſufficient imployment to ſuſtaine the fury of the Senates Souldiers, being better provided: which however was bravely ſupplyed by the noble valour of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in ſo much as he ſuſtained the violence of the tempeſt, untill his own horſe again came into his reſcue, though with ſuch a ſlaughter of his poor Subjects, that it created a paſſionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in his royall breaſt, although the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fate of his Crowne might very well have given a full imployment to his thoughts: Upon <hi>Thyaſmus</hi> appearing with his victorious Troopes, <hi>Dimogoras</hi> retired with his worſted Forces, and the night hindred further proſecution for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which as I may ſay, enviouſly ſhaddowed the Kings glory, who elſe could not have been defrauded as 'twas thought of a moſt abſolute Conqueſt to his immortall honour, if not to his Kingdoms proſperity.</p>
            <p>However he reſolved the next morning early,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169951:71"/>againe to ſet upon his enemies, who were retired for their better ſafety, within the protection of their ſecure Trenches; but contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation <hi>Dimogoras</hi> (belike fearing <hi>Euarchus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and unwilling to hazzard the Senates for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in one doubtfull adventure) had made uſe of the darke coverture of the night, to convey himſelfe and his whole Forces, to a ſtrong Towne not farre off, remaining under his juriſdiction: Nevertheleſſe, ſo much opinion this halfe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt got amongſt the common people, that many Cities preſently returned under the obedieuce of their lawfull Prince, whilſt in the meane time, the King made <hi>Philadelphia</hi> the chiefe reſidence of his Royall Court, where againe he began to rule like a Monarch, and ſuffered his other Generals in many parts of the Kingdome, to proſecute his commands with ſuch proſperous ſucceſſe, that in a ſhort ſpace he became in a manner maſter of all <hi>Lydia,</hi> though the great Towne of <hi>Sardis</hi> ſeemed ſtill with moſt obſtinate pride to contemne his power, being more in love with that paſſion, that made them hope to be a free City, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe to obtaine that money they had disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then mindfull of their own ſafety and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The King who began to thinke now the difficulty of his affaires were paſt all danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to play with the weakneſſe of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in ſo much as his Souldiers became neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in their diſcipline, as the commanders li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious in their courſe of life, which certainly contributed extreamely to all his misfortunes: for being provoked either by unwiſe, if not Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169951:72"/>Councell, or put on by his own juſt ſpleen, to ſee himſelfe in the height of all his Victories diſobeyed by weake Forces, ſuddenly beſieged a ſmall City that lay in the very heart of his new Conqueſts, conceiving his enemies wanted power of refiſtance, or at leaſt ability to bring him any incommodation, which made his Troopes leſſe carefull to prevent correſpondency; But the Towne finding it could not hold out long againſt ſo ſtrong a ſiege, gave private intelligence to the Citizens of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who apprehending the loſſe would abſolutely turne to their ruine, ſince the King would be ſure, as they believed, after to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the reſt of his endeavour in their ſubverſion, when he ſhould have finiſhed the deſigne in hand that only oppoſed him, of a ſudden ſent out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Dimogoras</hi> the Souldiers of <hi>Sardis</hi> it ſelfe, that untill then were never known to remove many Furlonges from the ſmoake of their own chimneyes, to try if it were poſſible to raiſe the Kings ſiege; and with as quick an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as they were able, marched towards the Campe, imagining that the ſucceſſe of this voyage was to determine their fates, whether to remaine free Citizens, or become conquered ſlaves. <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> when he heard of this new and unexpected ſupply, ſo much contrary to his imagination, however rumours thereof had formerly come to his eares, thought it his beſt courſe, rather to fight with them in the open Fields, then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in his Trenches, to hazard the danger of being ſtarved for want of proviſion: with theſe purpoſes, after he had quitted the Walls of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169951:72"/>Towne, he advanced towards their quarters, with a hope to ſet upon them in the plain Champaine, ſince he conceived he had much the advantage of horſe, though his foot was of a farre leſſe number. But though the King omitted no induſtry to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his deſigne, yet being betrayed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in his intelligence, who ever favoured the Senate more then their Soveraigne, <hi>Dimogoras</hi> got ſome dayes journey towards the City of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> before <hi>Euarchus</hi> knew of his remove; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the Generall being no other, now he had freed the City from danger, but to get againe ſafe with his whole Army to the place from whence he came: The King as he was enraged with this ſecret eſcape, ſo was he reſolved if it were poſſible to fight with him upon any termes, ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as he imagined, would prove in the opinion of the multitude of no leſſe a conſequence, then a Victory obtained by his adverſaries: To that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as ſoone as he had overtaken his enemies by tedious marches, he ſet upon them with deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inconveniences, not only for that they had locked themſelves in incloſed Countries, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came out of their Trenches to skirmiſh, by which meanes the Kings Cavalry proved of no ſervice; ſo that as I may ſay by reaſon of theſe unfortunate diſadvantages, <hi>Euarchus</hi> after twelve houres fight could pretend but to a very ſmall Victory; which ſucceſſe returned <hi>Dimogoras</hi> to the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> with ſome honour, in regard that however he had not beat the Kings Forces, it might be ſaid upon the matter he had worſted his deſignes.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:169951:73"/>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, although this gave the Generalls party not only encouragement for the preſent, but hopes in abundance in the future; eſpecially for that the Kings Souldiers every where; began both to be negligent and treacherous; more ſeeming to rely upon the ſuppoſed juſtneſſe of the cauſe, then reſolving conſtantly to defend it by any haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, yet the Senate at <hi>Sardis</hi> doubting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their own fortune or ſucceſſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what policy ſoever they could uſe in the Kings Campe, reſolved againe to bring in the <hi>Myſſians</hi> into <hi>Lydia</hi> with a powerfull Army: To this purpoſe they made a contract with them, not only to pay them a very great ſum of money, both to defray their charges and reward their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, but alſo promiſed to eſtabliſh in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe, the ſame manner of worſhip of the gods as was practiſed in <hi>Myſſia:</hi> As this ſeemed in effect to be the whole agreement between them; ſo the <hi>Myſſians</hi> wanted not in their meaning, underhand deſignes, which was to beare at leaſtwiſe an equall ſhare in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both Kingdomes, whereby the better to ſatisfie their pride and avarice; for the latter which as 'twas ſaid they would have ſold the gods themſelves, if they had been upon the earth ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
            <p>By this meanes againe <hi>Euarchus</hi> became invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in new troubles; for preſently after the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> having made this unhandſome accord to the Kings diſadvantage, notwithſtanding their ſo many vowes and promiſes to the contrary, there was imployed at the ſame time an Ambaſſadour
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169951:73"/>from the Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> not only to perſwade him to entertaine a new Treaty and friendſhip with his Senate ſitting at <hi>Sardis,</hi> but alſo abſolutely to break all correſpondency and friendſhip between himſelfe and the State of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which being condeſcended unto by the King he undertooke, as well to keep back the <hi>Myſſians</hi> from entring <hi>Lydia,</hi> as to ſettle an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute peace in all the reſt of his dominions: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe were only brags or no is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine; rather may it be thought, either the Kings Fate or unhappy Councell, thruſt him on upon thoſe wayes, that were moſt prejudiciall to his affaires: in concluſion he did not only deny the Ambaſſador the leaſt entertainment of theſe propoſitions, but at the ſame time alſo was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to publiſh a declaration againſt the City of <hi>Sardos;</hi> though at preſent it ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Senate, about the payment of that money promiſed to the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> in recompence for their expedition into <hi>Lydia.</hi> This I muſt needs ſay, ſo much exaſperated the Towne, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they went on with their accord by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conſent of all: when theſe ſummes were received, preſently the <hi>Myſſians</hi> marched into the Country with a huge Army, whilſt another was ſent with <hi>Dimogoras</hi> againſt the Kings own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: As by this meanes <hi>Euarchus</hi> was conſtrained to divide his Forces, ſo he ſent the greateſt part of his Army along under the command of <hi>Thyaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his Nephew, for the neceſſary raiſing of the ſiege before the City of <hi>Theatyra,</hi> where the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> were already incamped, however their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169951:74"/>power was encreaſed with ſuch Troopes, as the Senate had commanded to joyne with them in that ſervice: Prince <hi>Thyaſmus</hi> upon his approach (whether being as I may ſay too precipitate in his conduct, or that he was betrayed abſolutely in his intelligence) when he came neere the Towne, thinking either to ſurprize or defeat the enemy in an inſtant, of the contrary ſuddenly he became involved in a moſt deſperate Ambuſcado, which in a manner deſtroyed the perſons or the courages of his whole Army, though in truth the <hi>Myſſians</hi> performed the leaſt part of the ſervice: But the King being followed and furiouſly attempted in his march as I ſaid by <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> he kept himſelf and Troopes (though fewer by many in number) upon ſuch ſure and couragious grounds, that the Generall at laſt was brought into ſo many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inconveniences, by reaſon of his want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and providence, that although <hi>Euarchus</hi> at that time fought not one ſtroake, he was forced to compound for the lives and liberties of all his Souldiers, which was an occaſion that preſently turned out <hi>Dimogoras</hi> out of his office, whilſt in the interim there was put into his place one <hi>Farezius,</hi> whoſe melancholly valour in a very ſhort time prevailed exceedingly, for that the <hi>Myſſians</hi> had cauſed the King to divide his Forces into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeverall commands, that he could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently maintaine a conſiderable body together under any Captaine, to be able to contend with power ſufficient: wherefore after ſome Councell taken with his beſt friends, the King reſolved himſelfe in perſon, to endeavour to ſtop the fury
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169951:74"/>of this new and prevailing Generall, that ſeemed like an outragious Torrent, to carry all before him, whether he marched againſt Townes or Armies.</p>
            <p>The King beſides the inflammation of his own naturall courage, was put on to fight with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius,</hi> as 'twas thought upon theſe reaſons: firſt to prevent a conjunction between him and the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> who were as yet at ſome diſtance: next to continue a life in his own party, that ſeemed ſomething to decline his aſſiſtance in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdome, in regard of the others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſucceſſe: And laſt of all, for that both money and other proviſions failing, he began to contract many neceſſities in his army: It was not long before they both met upon a large Plaine in an open Countrey, that afforded roome enough for an equall contention, if the Fates had at all proved indifferent in the encounter; The firſt charge was given with fury ſufficient by both ſides, however the Kings horſe without any known cauſe whatſoever of a ſudden gave back, and not long after moſt ſhamefully turned their backs, though the foot with incredible gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſtill continued the fight with honour and ſafety: <hi>Euarchus</hi> upon this (however not being ſo much amazed as diſpleaſed) preſently rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the flying Troopes; as it were calling both gods and men to witneſſe, concerning the juſtneſſe of his cauſe, and the unfainedneſſe of his intentions; withall perſwading them either to ſhew more courage or leſſe diſloyalty: not onely in his words, but by his own unexampled cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169951:75"/>evidently expreſſed before their faces, he conjured them to fight, or at leaſtwiſe to ſtand their ground at ſome diſtance, whilſt he and the reſt expoſed their lives to the fury of the enemy; calling them ſometimes his country men and ſubjects; otherwhile he termed them no better then unworthy ſlaves, that precipitately followed their own deſtruction and captivity; when as they had a faire occaſion offered them to be both glorious and happy: but at laſt ſeeing nothing would prevaile, he looked up to heaven with tears in his eyes, beſeeching that the gods would take pitty on him in his neceſſities, at leaſtwiſe prove propitious to the Monarchy of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med abſolutely to depend upon this dayes adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Thus between praying, fighting, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, he continued, untill he ſaw moſt of his Souldiers either taken or ſlaughtered: ſo that at laſt, being conſtrained with a very few number in his company to quit the Field, he left his Campe to the courteſie of the enemies mercy, whilſt by obſcure paſſages he got againe ſafe in perſon (though much in his thoughts dejected) to the ſtrong Towne of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where not long after by the whole power of <hi>Farezius,</hi> he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with the reſt of his Court, friends, and family.</p>
            <p>As this, ſaid he, was the proceeding of that fatall day, ſo may I ſuppoſe by the diſperſing of the moſt part of the company, it will be alſo time for us to retire: ſo taking <hi>Narciſſus</hi> by the hand, he promiſed he ſhould have the reſt of his diſcourſe at home.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:169951:75"/>
            <p>His houſe was ſeated at the end of a ſmall town, only divided by a pleaſant grove of wood, that encompaſſed a round Temple, built with Jonick Columns; within which was the ſtatue of <hi>Apollo:</hi> when they had performed ſome few devotions, according to the manner of the country, amongſt other Prieſts of their own order that remained in the place, the old father led him to his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being entered into the Parlour, he preſently ſhewed him the picture of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> which for ſome time he had kept as he ſaid in an obſcure corner of his houſe, though now he ſeemed to expect more freedome; whereupon he began to read a lecture concerning his life and diſpoſition: which gave him an occaſion to diſcourſe in this manner:</p>
            <p>The father of <hi>Euarchus</hi> our now King, being a Prince wholly given as I may ſay to his own pleaſure, only ſtudied wayes to keep himſelfe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life in a quiet ſecurity: &amp; to this purpoſe he not only brought up his ſonne, after the death of his elder brother in learning and domeſtick exerciſes, under the protect of his own eye and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but when he came to yeares of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he endeavoured with ſome violence, to marry him to the King of <hi>Aegypts</hi> daughter, by whoſe greatneſſe he thought to eſtabliſh his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power the better in <hi>Lydia,</hi> perceiving his ſubjects were apt enough upon all occaſions, to kick againſt his authority: But finding the Treaty was protracted, he ſent his ſon in perſon with an intimate favourite of his, into <hi>Africa</hi> to court the young Lady: To be ſhort the journey produced
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169951:76"/>no effects at all anſwerable to his deſires: for the two favourites of each Prince claſhing together, although a certaine day was appointed for the marriage, yet the match broake, though upon what grounds I neither know, or can well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: after this breach <hi>Euarchus</hi> made preſently his addreſſe to <hi>Hyacinthia</hi> our now Queen, being ſiſter to <hi>Orſames</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> eſteemed a moſt mortall enemy to the greatneſſe of the Kingdome and Monarchy of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> no ſooner was this match concluded, but the old King dyed, leaving young <hi>Euarchus</hi> to inherit in outward appearance, as much glory and proſperity, as was poſſible to be enjoyed by mortality upon earth; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for many years, untill theſe late unhappy difference obſtructed his felicity: which truly I muſt the rather bewaile, in regard that he is a Prince given to no manner of vice: however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome will ſay, he is more beholding to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his inclination, then to reſolution for his temperance, unto which I muſt needs anſwer, that as the world ought not to take any notice of the inward thoughts of man, when people receive a generall commodity by the outward expreſſions of vertues; ſo of the other ſide, when good and laudable actions are accompanied with an entire juſtice in appearance, it is unpoſſible but either the gods have placed ſuch upon earth, to become rare examples for imitation to others, or elſe have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them to be extreamely beneficiall to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo that both wayes deſerve ſingular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and preſervation: and this without any partiality, may be ſaid to be the right character
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169951:76"/>of the diſpoſition of <hi>Euarchus:</hi> now for his active parts, that are and have been obvious to all the world; no man can accuſe him of cruelty or pride: his deare affections to his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are beyond the patterne of all his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: his activity and ſolicitation almoſt not to be imitated: his moderation in Dyet and Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſcarce equals any of his ſubjects: if his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimony can be imputed to him for a fault, let his numerous iſſue, and the ſmall extent of his own revenues, make for him at leaſtwiſe a probable, if not a ſufficient excuſe: beſides, and over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe ſpecified vertues, I muſt commend his diſcreet valour, and entire patience, ſince as in the one he never declined any engagement, when the neceſſity of his fortune, did any way ſtand in need of the demonſtration of his courage, ſo did he never yet appeare overcome by paſſion, when he taſted the greateſt bitterneſſe of what affliction ſoever: with theſe words the Prieſt, as if he had been tranſported with the very apprehenſion of his ſuffering, ſeemed to end his diſcourſe both in tears and ſighes; and certainly had ſo continued for a long ſpace in a certaine kinde of extaſie, if an old woman and a little youth (the whole family with himſelfe of his private habitation) had not interrupted his ſorrowfull contemplation, by bringing into the Parlour Wine and other junkets to entertain <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who notwithſtanding, after he had taſted ſufficiently of that civility, put him in mind againe of his promiſed relation in the field, which was to make an end ſo farre of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, concerning King <hi>Euarchus</hi> fortunes,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169951:77"/>that he might be inſtructed in the reaſons of the joyfull aſſembly of the people, dancing about the Altar and Statue of god <hi>Pan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prieſt, after he had acknowledged in ſome ſort his own digreſſions from the matter intended, he let him know that as it was no part of his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deprive him of his due, according to his own obligation, ſo he deſired him to excuſe his paſſion in the Kings behalfe, occaſioned only by the ſight of the picture that ſuddenly brought into his mind a certaine kind of repreſentation of his heroicall vertues, proceeding from his nature and education: whereupon preſently leading <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> into his Garden furniſhed him with many dainty flowers of all ſorts, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> curioſity he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to take an extraordinary delight, at laſt they both ſeated themſelves in one of the Arbours, neatly contrived to defend the inward part of the habitation from <hi>Phoebus</hi> oppreſſion, which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſufficient conveniency for diſcourſe, and that joyned with the opportunity, quickly entered him into his new relation after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſaid he, being as I told you retired to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> after the Battle, as ſoon as he came into the Towne, he went preſently to his Garden without ſpeaking one word to any perſon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many Troopes followed him with paſſion to know ſome particulars concerning his fortunes, the rather for that they conceived themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be ſufficiently intereſted in his fate; There he walked with a quick pace according to his cuſtome, ſometimes caſting his arme abroad, and otherwhiles againe beating his breaſt with no
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169951:77"/>ſmall violence; then would he look up to the heavens, as if a little he accuſed the gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to ſuffer him that intended nothing but juſtice and goodneſſe, to be ſo cruelly perſecuted by his owne Subjects, without any known cauſe whatſoever; ſo that in truth the whole company with teares in their eyes, began more to conſider his inward ſufferings, then their own outward ſtate and condition: thus I ſay he continued, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Prince <hi>Thyaſmus,</hi> his unfortunate Nephew (who not long before had retired thither with his beaten and ſcattered Troopes) came alſo with a few Attendants into the Garden: when he had ſaluted the King with a ſad look (walking with him in that manner two or three turnes) he at laſt humbly deſired him to let the company under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a little of his unfortunate paſſages, ſince they could not be worſe as he ſaid then they imagined them to be, and for ought they knew they might be better then they ſuppoſed: the King went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and ſeated himſelfe upon a Bench, whilſt all the company flockt about him, though he only made a diſcourſe to them in this nature:</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, ſaid he, you now behold <hi>Euarchus</hi> tumbled from his Throne: it is apparant the gods are diſpleaſed with our actions; neither doe I well know what will become of this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kingdome, for however they puniſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their indignation oftentimes by evill and wicked inſtruments, yet they never ſhew their diſpleaſure and indignation, but where of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are apparant enough to deſerve that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizement: whether theſe faults (for which for

In my opinion the beſt way is, inſtantly to take aſunder by way of profitable conſideration all our particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts; and ſo by wholſome, and true repentance if it be poſſible to give ſome ſtop to the furious Torrent of our misfortunes, before they come to ſuch a Sea of confuſion, that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a generall deſtruction muſt follow: when I conſider the pride, covetouſneſſe, and diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own family, I am partly convinced in my thoughts, that the ills we have ſuffered, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from that originall: againe, when I look upon the diſobedience, luxury, and atheiſme of the whole Kingdome, I may ſuppoſe from the peoples impieties have come our misfortunes: If I have been too blame for either, I muſt rather implore the gods pardon for my omiſſions, then overmuch accuſe my own intentions that made them ſo; ſince however my nature may be too paſſively indulgent in ſuch particulars, yet my
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169951:78"/>diſpoſition was not at all, prone to give them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and approbation: I muſt confeſſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether free my ſelfe from every imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hath been caſt upon my government; for it is no ſmall fault to be remiſſe in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where crimes may be encouraged to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; though much more to be countenanced in oppreſſion: And where inferiour officers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted though not commanded to be unjuſt, the Prince ought to beare a ſhare in the active part, for that he had the power to have reſtrained the miſchiefe; which perhaps is the occaſion of my preſent ſuffering with the reſt of my Subjects, and what more indignation the gods have in ſtore, I cannot be certaine to prevent; only I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, without a deep examination of our inward thoughts, the conſcience will not be ſufficiently underſtood, whereby to be cleere in any kinde to purpoſe, however our principles may be right and good, for without it, neither ſorrow nor ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction can follow of any conſiderable value to blot out the remembrance of ſuch evils, and ſo conſequently a continuation of the puniſhment due to the nature of our offences will not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. It is not enough to ſay our enemies want juſtice and legality in their proſecution, for that they may be made for the preſent only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revengers, though themſelves be reſerved for a higher and more exemplary torments: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever actions of proſperity and ſucceſſe, be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes markes of favour and approbation, yet ought they juſtly be eſteemed teſtimonies of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt againſt thoſe Nations, and ſuch perſons that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169951:79"/>unfortunately are rendred Subjects of miſery and chaſtizement, ſince none ever ſuffers without a cauſe: when revolutions happen (if we would but ſeriouſly enough looke after the reaſon) in the generall we ſhould find, matter ſufficient to convince our beliefe, that we are not totally inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent almoſt in any particular; when as the gods are oftentimes accuſtomed to preſerve the whole, for their ſakes, that may pretend juſtly to any thing extraordinary: No my friends, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath been for ſome yeares paſt, involved in too much ſuperfluity, to expect long a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindfull from whence proceeds originally all good and commodity: when peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity exceedingly abound in any region, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at all bridled and reſtrained, by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary temperance and conſideration, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be expected ſoon after but captivity or deſtruction, to recall againe mens thoughts and actions to moderation, neceſſary for a new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſervation: this world was created but as the tryer and touchſtone of our diſpoſitions for the better eſtabliſhment of our eternall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter, ſince otherwiſe certainly it had not been made at all: In this conſiſts the only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of mankind; that we look at preſent as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall acquiſitious belonging properly to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without any relation to the future, when as they are I ſay intended either as accidentall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or naturall conſolations, neceſſary in ſome ſort for our temporary ſubſiſtance: if we be great, mighty, and proſperous, we expect eaſe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169951:79"/>pleaſure, and obſervance, as meere duties that ſhould attend us, inſtead of making our thoughts thereby become more gratefull, humble, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous in all our endeavours, not only to augment vertue and purchaſe grace, but to diſtribute our endeavours alſo by charity and reaſon, to thoſe that are more indigent upon earth: what a King or commander hath in honour and power, ſhould be imployed in care and induſtry for the generall good: and if a begger or inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wants in riches and proſperity, it ought to be ſupplyed by being free from hazzard and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: by which meanes all ſorts of people may participate in a kinde of an equality, according to the intention of their firſt creation; ſince the gods certainly intended no abſolute difference but what their inſcrutable decrees have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the future, anſwerable to the endeavours of every one in particular: for however the things belonging to this life ſometimes may vary by way of accident in the world, yet the reaſonable and more noble part of man, ſhould be alike free in every one of us by the ſame rule of eſtimation and pretention. This conſideration makes me at preſent looke upon my ſelfe and you in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery, with the ſame eyes of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration: wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a moſt ſtrict account, what I have acted, and how I may ſuffer; ſo would I have you alſo examine your conſciences, wherein you have offended, and in what nature you may be remedied; by this meanes, if it be yet poſſible to procure ſome mercy from the gods in our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169951:80"/>preſſing neceſſities; Theſe I ſay are intentions not onely moſt pious, but extreame ſafe: with theſe words he inſtantly roſe from his ſeat, and retired into his private chamber, that not onely forced teares but occaſioned diſcourſe from moſt of the company.</p>
            <p>But whilſt the King, and the Inhabitants of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelpha</hi> with deſparing thoughts, were buſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the better fortifying of the Towne, againſt the expected ſiege of <hi>Farezius,</hi> who every day was looked for which his Troops to attempt the ſame (though moſt part of them intended, rather to mend their conditions by yielding at laſt upon milder termes, then entertained in their hopes any probability of prevailing againſt his Forces) of a ſudden the <hi>Myſſians</hi> fearing leſt they might be deceived in their expectations, both in the money they expected from the Senate, as alſo concerning an equall ſhare in the government of the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for that they had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to themſelves and nation in the Battles, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contempt for the little valour they had ſhewed, then any way gained credit in the Warres, beſiedged another Towne belonging to the Kings party, not yet reduced under the Senates juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; where however they had continued for ſome weekes, yet at length they were beaten off both with loſſe and diſgrace; in ſo much as then not knowing well how to play their Cards with any advantage, they began as their laſt refuge, not onely publikely to diſpute the Kings Titles, whom as they pretended the Senate had oppreſſed beyond their intentions; but imployed the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169951:80"/>of a certaine Ambaſſador of <hi>Syria</hi> in their Army, to perſwade <hi>Euarchus,</hi> if it were poſſible to make an eſcape from the City of <hi>Philadelpha,</hi> whereby to put his perſon into their hands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing in the interim his hopes, both preſent ſafety and future proſperity, as people being (as they ſaid) his own native country-men, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his condition nothing but good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their aſſiſtance according to his owne deſire.</p>
            <p>The King having received this comfortable meſſage, which pretended a lucky <hi>Omen</hi> as he imagined to the reſt of his occaſions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Farezius</hi> had newly beſieged <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> one day he called me privately into his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber: when he had made faſt the doore with a certaine kinde of extraordinary earneſtneſſe in his countenance, according to the manner he uſed in any thing he went about (being in truth a Prince, that is not only ſollicitous in his thoughts but indefatigable in his paines and actions) he told me, that as he had a ſecret of much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to impart unto me, ſo was he affraid left it ſhould come to the knowledge of any that were not intended to be imployed in the buſineſſe, doubting he had ſo many Traytors attending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his perſon, that it was impoſſible almoſt, for any deſigne to be put in execution, without the Senates privity and knowledge: wherefore though he were ſufficiently confident of my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by reaſon of the long experience he had had of my ſervice, and the tryall he had experimented of my honeſty and religion, yet for that one or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169951:81"/>two more were neceſſarily to be uſed in the ſame adventure, he reſolved to exact from me, not only my faithfull promiſe, but a religious oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the performance of my truſt tending to his commands: after I had aſſured him by verball proteſtations, that I would be ready to lay downe my life in any thing his Majeſty ſhould think me capable, either of acting or ſuffering for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he made me preſently kneele downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Statue of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which he had alwayes ſtanding in his chamber: and where moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he made his own morning prayers: there moſt ſolemnly I renewed thoſe undertakings: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he diſcovered unto me his deſignes, which was in a diſguiſed habite as my ſervant to paſſe through <hi>Farezius</hi> campe in my company, and ſo privately to convey himſelfe into the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Army, whither as he told me he had beene lately envited, with aſſurance of their aſſiſtance towards his proſperity and protection: although I muſt confeſſe I was not much enamoured of the project, knowing the baſe eſteemed falſhood of that people, yet leſt the King might ſuſpect any unwillingneſſe in my diſpoſition, to hazzard my perſon in his ſervice, I durſt neither open my thoughts, or deliver my opinion, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might have ſhewed him ſome reaſons, that would have procured alteration; however I knew of the other ſide, his ſtraights and neceſſities were ſufficiently preſſing in regard of the ſiege, to cauſe him almoſt, to venture upon what deſperate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne whatſoever: in concluſion I undertooke to provide within three dayes ſpace, both horſes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169951:81"/>and other conveniences to that purpoſe, whilſt the King in the interim writ a Letter with ſome few directions to his Nephew Prince <hi>Thyaſmus,</hi> whom he had lately made Governour of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delpha,</hi> which was to render the Towne to the enemy after ſuch a time mentioned, with the beſt conditions he could make for himſelfe, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration alſo being had both of his Court and friends: beſides he directed other writings to his eldeſt Son <hi>Arethuſius,</hi> who remained then in the fartheſt part of the Kingdome, attended by ſome few Forces of his own, to tranſport himſelfe with all expedition to his mother the Queen, to whoſe commands he wiſhed him to be obſequious in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that concerned all their affaires; ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in truth not only a Lady he loves beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but whoſe birth and intereſt may procure him aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, within three daies time I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all things neceſſary for the Kings journey: To this purpoſe he was clothed after the manner of the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſlaves, who are accuſtomed to be imployed about ſervile works in the field; onely he had over his under apparrell, a blew mantle with ſhort and large ſleeves: he wore upon his head a high bonnet in colour red, with three or four feathers taken from a cocks taile: upon his legs were faſtned certaine black buskins of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with buckles; betimes in the morning we iſſued out of the Town both on horſ-back, my ſervant riding before a great bag that was oyled all over to prevent the prejudice of raine, ſince I had put ſome neceſſary accommodations for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169951:82"/>our voyage therein; however nothing at all that could be any way ſuſpicious, although it might be our fortunes to be taken by the enemy, which in truth ſo fell out accordingly: for paſſing through the firſt watch, we were not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſtand, the ſouldiers preſently deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of us from whence wee came, but alſo as ſuſpicious perſons we were carried before an Officer of the Army to be examined: I did not deny but that I came out of the Town of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelpha;</hi> however I told them, that as I was onely there by accident, to viſit ſome friends and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch other neceſſary buſineſſes, with certain ſchollers that lived in the Academy, who med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with nothing but what concerned their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo was I againe repairing to the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where for the moſt part I remained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by profeſſion a Prieſt that obſerved the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> rights in my ordinary ſacrificing to the gods. This ſmooth tale I had hoped would have freed me preſently; yet they kept us all that day and the next night, with a pretention the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall was not at leaſure, without whoſe diſcharge and allowance (as they ſaid) we could neither paſſe, or be at liberty: tis true, their chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to get money from us; but I muſt confeſſe I durſt not overbountifully offer them any, in regard it would have given the more occaſion of jealouſie and ſuſpition: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, notwithſtanding they ſeemed to detaine me as a priſoner, yet I got leave for my ſervant, to be in ſome ſort free in the camp, whereby to have the conveniency (as I pretended) to provide
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169951:82"/>ſome accommodation neceſſary for the horſes, who in that office performed his duty ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that I muſt tell you he was conſtrained all night to lie in the open field, without any coverture whatſoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempeſtuous ſeaſon: in this manner we were perplexed between feare and ſuffering, however I muſt confeſſe I little doubted the Kings diſcovery; not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his habit, but that he had alſo ſhaved his beard in a moſt antick faſhion. In concluſion the good humour of the Generall the next day, or rather the Souldiers finding there was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be got from us, not onely diſcharged me from my further attendance, but gave a Paſſe for me and my ſervant to travell freely to the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> without any let or hindrance from any of their party; which proved to be of no ſmall conveniency unto us in all our journey: for although the protection onely mentioned that Town, where we leaſt intended to goe, yet as ſoon as I was out of the camp, I ſo finely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the writing with my own pen, that I made it moſt aptly ſerve for every place and region; in ſo much as by reaſon thereof in our journey, we were neither letted nor troubled to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, having a diſcharge preſently amongſt all manner of Officers of theirs, as ſoon as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the paper, when as without doubt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we had been infallibly taken and impriſoned, ſince thoſe parts where we travelled, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extream ſuſpicious by order from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in regard of the Declarations of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:169951:83"/>of purpoſe ſo commanded, the better as they thought to prevent all entercourſe and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency between the Kings party and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation.</p>
            <p>In this manner at laſt we arrived in the <hi>Myſſian</hi> camp, and with a great ſatisfaction (I muſt needs ſay) to the Kings thoughts, however his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions were not preſently to diſcover his perſon; ſo that retiring into a little Village not very farre from the Army, he ſent me (after I had taken ſome ſmall refreſhment) to enquire for the <hi>Syrian</hi> Ambaſſadour, upon whoſe ſcore he rather ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any abſolute confidence he could have in the <hi>Myſſians</hi> fidelity, in regard that they had already ſo often deceived him with their faire promiſes and falſe actions; it was my part, in complements to tell him as much, after I had made him acquainted with the Kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall. As the Ambaſſadour appeared ſomewhat amazed at the newes, ſo did he not ſtick to aſſure me, that he knew his Majeſty would be received by the Army with all honour and ſafety, and preſently went along with me to finde him out. The King after ſome few civilities, uſed this language to the Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid he, as you now ſee me in a poſture far below my birth and dignity, ſo the gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the preſent ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my perſon according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; this I hope is ſufficient to ſhew what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I have to put my ſelfe into the hands of my
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169951:83"/>native Countreymen: if either the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my paſt benefits, beſtowed upon them in the generall, or any compaſſionate reflection upon my unfortunate ſtate, at the inſtant are motives ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to work upon humanity, I ſhall be ſafe here, and may be proſperous hereafter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I would not have them to worke upon my miſeries for poor and contemptible gaine, ſo ſhall not I remember them any more of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ingratitude and diſobedience: but rather let us both unite in ſuch a conſtant conjunction, that as by their means I may come againe to be King, ſo will they ever by ſuch an act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe oblige me to govern for their benefit: they cannot but conſider with what little probability they can hope for any eſtabliſhment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> but by my means, when as already the Senate doth not onely diſvalue their actions and proceedings by moſt diſgracefull and contemptible ſpeeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their affaires to a proſperous iſſue (whereby they have no more need of their aſſiſtance, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently would be rid of the trouble) they not onely diſpute with them the Titles and reaſons of their own intereſt, but even deny them the payment of their juſt due, for all thoſe ſervices they have performed for their advantages in <hi>Lydia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Ambaſſadour did not make any great reply to the Kings diſcourſe, but in a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, concerning his own ſervices, ſo did he preſently conduct him to his houſe for his better accommodation; where he gave preſent order
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169951:84"/>to have him furniſhed with apparell and other neceſſaries, whilſt in the interim (as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) he acquainted <hi>Lycius</hi> the Generall, and the reſt of the Officers of the Army, with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall in the camp: After two or three daies time the Ambaſſadour not onely expoſed the King to the view of the people, but delivered him into the protection of the ſouldiers; where however <hi>Lycius</hi> and ſome of the principall of the Nobility, entertained his preſence with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary outward humility; yet nevertheleſſe with certain kind of ſad and diſtruſtfull looks and countenances, they performed their duties and reſpects in kiſſing his hands, and uſing other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much leſſe conſenting to his journey; the King, notwithſtanding he ſeemed not to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their actions in publique, but of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary gave teſtimonies of joy and gladneſſe, at the apprehenſion of his happy fortune; yet in private, by many words and ſighes, he expreſſed his own doubts, and opinion concerning his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture entertainment; the rather, in regard they preſently ſet a ſtrict gard upon his perſon, though pretending it to be done for no other end but for his greater honour and ſafety: however his hopes became ſomething better ſatisfied, for that they admitted freely to his converſations, not onely many of his houſhold ſervants that were come from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> after the Town was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>Farezius,</hi> but ſome of thoſe Prieſts alſo of his owne faction, that were under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Flamins.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:169951:84"/>
            <p>In this manner the King remained for divers weeks, delighting his thoughts with ſuch recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as had been almoſt made cuſtomary to his nature, by continuall practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could ſeem pleaſed with ſuch triviall things in the height of his vexations and diſcontents. Again, it was ſpightfully laid to his charge by his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his throne, when as he appeared not to have apprehention enough to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible, of what conſequence the loſſe of a kingdome was: but probably either he had ſo much wiſdome, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right conſideration, or was endued with ſuch a ſupream goodneſſe in his diſpoſition, as perſwaded him to beare his afflictions with no ordinary temper and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>In the interim the <hi>Myſſians</hi> were not idle, to play their game to the beſt advantage, both with the Senate and the King: for as of one ſide they made the Senate believe, they had a mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Kings injuries and ſufferings, both out of honour and Religion; ſo did they alwaies tell the King, that he muſt give ſatisfaction to the demands of either Kingdome, before they could become inſtrumentall in his eſtabliſhment; which drew on their conſultations to the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the Kings perſon into their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, out of right and juſtice, in regard they had been onely hired in the warres and ſervice of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169951:85"/>
               <hi>Lydia,</hi> by their money; ſo that conſequently they were obliged with a punctuall decorum to obſerve their commands in every thing: of the other ſide <hi>Euarchus</hi> party affirmed; that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> as well as <hi>Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ought to have as particular an intereſt in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and preſervation, as the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> in proſecution of which, they were to ſee him again reſtored to his Crown and dignity, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any deſire to the contrary: but whilſt theſe diſputations laſted, as I may ſay, with ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bitterneſſe of either ſide, which as 'twas thought, would inſtantly have cauſed a cruell and bloudy warre between both Nations, one <hi>Argilius</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Myſſia</hi> came ſuddenly from his own Countrey into the Campe, who from the very beginning of the ſtirs had been a main oppoſer (by reaſon of his own covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ambition) of the Kings intereſt in that Nation: intending thereby more abſolutely to govern all the affaires of that kingdome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: when he arrived he preſently went to the counſell of the Army, where he made this oration unto them.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen ſaid he, I underſtand you are now aſſembled about theſe conſultations, that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kings particular concernments; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding from the earneſt ſolicitation of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Ambaſſador: and partly in regard <hi>Euarchus</hi> is now preſent amongſt you in the Camp: In my opinion it is more juſt and convenient, in the firſt place to look upon the gods worſhip: in the next to mind our own preſervations: to this purpoſe in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169951:85"/>my judgement it ought to be conſidered, why we took up Armes at all in the beginning to oppoſe our Prince, if now without any other condition whatſoever we ſhould lay them downe, and againe reſtore him to his ancient dignity without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? I pray, remember we have made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proteſtation to the gods, as of the other ſide a confederation with our friends: and if we breake with both, no doubt but heaven and earth will accuſe us as well of perjury as indiſcretion; ſince we ſhould ſeem, neither to reverence ſacred things as we are bound, nor preſerve humane ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations as we ought: may you not remember, we took from our King his power for no other reaſon, but becauſe we thought him not fit to raigne over us, accompanied with his ſtubborne and wilfull crimes; and ſhall we preſently reſtore him to that State againe without amendment? are we not tyed by promiſes to the Senate of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> faithfully to performe their buſineſſes in theſe Warres, whilſt we are under their pay and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction? and ſhall we detaine the very object of their intentions againſt their minds, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected perſon by our Army, who was the onely booty they aymed at to purchaſe by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? O horrid injuſtice and more pernitious indiſcretion, ſince in the one undoubtedly we exaſperate the gods anger, as in the other we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly endanger our own ſafeties; for as they cannot but revenge, their own diſhonour in the higheſt fury of their wrath, in regard of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, ſo juſtly may the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> over-run our Kingdom, for not performing thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169951:86"/>we contracted for, before we entered their Countrey; which however may be a Warre of ſome long contention and diſpute; yet the effects muſt needs be bloudy and expencefull; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I meane the great Senate at <hi>Sardis)</hi> we ſhall not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch an amity, as probably will make both Nations happy, but for the preſent fill our coffers with ſufficient gold, to render us in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich with other Countries of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By releaſing the King I ſay without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, we give him only power and conveniency, inſtead of being gratefull for the benefit, to puniſh us for having been at the firſt the chief occaſion, that made him at all ſtand in need of ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: This diſpoſition of his hath bin ſufficiently experimented in his neceſſities, when as he wil not ſo farre gratifie us as to put the <hi>Flamins</hi> out of the Temples: Theſe reaſons being conſidered I ſay, let us preſently diſpatch meſſengers to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> with full power and commiſſion from this Army, not only to Treat of conditions, but to conclude with that Councell, concerning thoſe conditions and Articles which ſhall be thought fit to be offered to the King to confirme, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be reſtored to his Crowne, or releaſed from his impriſonment: ſo ſhall we be pious to the gods, juſt to our friends, and beneficiall to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Although there was much contradiction, and ſtrong diſputes concerning this oration of <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> yet in regard <hi>Lycius</hi> the generall, with many others of his faction in the Councell, were againſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169951:86"/>the Kings deſires; An abſolute determination was preſently there taken, to ſend <hi>Argilius</hi> with ſome other Commiſſioners to the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> whereby to conclude ſuch propoſitions, as ſhould be held moſt advantagable as they ſaid for both Nations; Though it was well knowne the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> had only an intention to good themſelves; not only in the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard of their ſecret intentions by <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſuppreſſion, to have an equall ſhare in the government of the Kingdom of <hi>Lydia:</hi> but however they concluded, to put in execution their reſolutions with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, yet they ſtill kept the King in hopes by faire promiſes of his reſtoration, as well to couzen and deceive his expectation, that he might not entertaine new thoughts, or fall upon other Counſels, as that he might not be irreconcilably diſtaſted with their actions, if they ſhould miſſe of their agreement with the Senate of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who they doubted might be ſomething unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to part with thoſe vaſt ſummes that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; which fayling, they intended to make uſe both of the Kings Titles and countenance, to proſecute their other deſignes, either in <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe or any other part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
            <p>The propoſitions they offered to the Senate were theſe: Firſt, that the ſolemne proteſtation formerly agreed upon ſhould be taken by every perſon of both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himſelfe to be exempted: ſecondly not onely the juriſdiction but the very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169951:87"/>name of the <hi>Flamins</hi> to be abſolutely aboliſhed, and no other rights and manner of worſhip of the gods, to be uſed but according to the cuſtomes of <hi>Myſſia:</hi> Thirdly, that both <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſo farre to be diſinabled in their authority, that each Senate in both Kingdomes might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confident of their power, whereby to be freed in their own opinions from all danger and ſuſpition in the future: Fourthly, that ſuch ſums of money ſhould ſpeedily be payed to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> as was promiſed for their ſatisfaction; and Laſtly, Commiſſioners to be choſen out of either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to whom the common tranſaction of affairs ſhould be equally committed.</p>
            <p>Although theſe two latter Articles were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſputed, yet it was not long before it was agreed, that theſe conditions being preſented and the King refuſing to ſubſcribe them, he ſhould be detained as a priſoner, and not acknowledged for a Prince: <hi>Argylius</hi> and the reſt returning to the Campe, (where the King to be ſhort refuſing his ſubſcription and conſent) within a very few weeks, imployed for the circumſtances neceſſarily belonging to every performance, <hi>Euarchus</hi> was by the conduction of ſome Troopes of horſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the cuſtody of <hi>Farezius,</hi> who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed him with his own Souldiers, to a faire houſe formerly belonging to the Kings of <hi>Lydia:</hi> Of the other ſide, both <hi>Argylius</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> marched into their own Countrey of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> with money and triumph, as if they had deſerved immortall fame, for their diſloyalty, which for the preſent muſt end my dolefull ſtory, ſince the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169951:87"/>time of the day envites us to take part of a ſlender ſupper, according to the warning of the little Bell I heare: however before you goe to bed, I engage my ſelfe, to furniſh you with another rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more pleaſing to my thoughts, that occaſioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with ſuch expreſſions of joy as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: ſo taking <hi>Narciſſus</hi> by the hand, he led him into a pretty roome, where they found two or three diſhes of meat newly ſet upon the Table, attended onely by the old woman and the youth. After they had given thankes to the gods, within an hours ſpace they ended their ſupper; the cloth being preſently taken away, and ſome few other diſcourſes of delight fitteſt for digeſtion paſt over, the Prieſt againe began this new relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſaid he, being thus entered as I told you into a new captivity (though farre more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſed) was conſtrained to attend the comming of the commiſſioners of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> to <hi>Sardis,</hi> for the further diſpoſure of his perſon and affaires: but in the interim the Souldiers, whether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their cuſtome and vocation, reflecting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the miſeries and afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or pretentions for their future intentions, to quarrell with the Senate, about their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, in ſeeing the <hi>Myſſians</hi> eſteemed and themſelves neglected, not onely by degrees began to uſe the King gently, but openly to complaine, that themſelves were ſo farre from receiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for their ſervices, as that they had not been juſtly paid their wages: when as the <hi>Myſſians</hi> as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169951:88"/>they ſaid, received great ſummes of money, for doing nothing elſe but running away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their King: alſo they ſeemed exaſperated, to have them countenanced in ſetting up their manner of worſhip of the gods, throughout all the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to the enſlaving as was urged of the Nation in the free liberty of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; when as the people according as had bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, could not exerciſe their own manner of worſhip: beſides they ſeemed extreamly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine that <hi>Myſſian</hi> governours ſhould be joyned with thoſe of <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe, in the management of State affaires, that belonged properly onely to the Nation: neither did theſe diſcontented diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes end in this manner; for they daily aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in private Counſels, to produce ſomething for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what either to demand or act: however theſe proceedings were ſoone brought to the knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous alſo of their own intentions, were a great deale the more fearfull of any dangerous accidents; ſo that preſently they ſent meſſengers to the Army, though as 'twas ſaid with intentions to perſwade, yet with authority to command the Souldiers to a better obedience: but as theſe officers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely deceived in their expectations, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own power and intereſt in the Campe, ſo were they forced with expedition to returne to thoſe that ſent them, with ſome terrour in their countenances; As this for many dayes, cauſed ſometimes diſtracted Counſels, otherwhiles more peremptory diſcourſes, ſo was it not over long
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169951:88"/>before the Senate, was ſaluted with a declaration from the Souldiers, wherein they not onely taxed them, with want of juſtice and extreame ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Army, that had fought ſo many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and ſhed ſo much bloud for themſelves and the priviledges of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but alſo preſented their conſiderations with theſe following propoſals, wherein they wiſht to be ſpeedily ſatisfied: firſt, that they might with all expedition not onely be paid their juſt dues, but in a convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deſerts: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that no part of the Army ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded without their owne conſents: Thirdly, that ſuch lawes and decrees might preſently be eſtabliſhed, to aſſure the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> of their convenient liberties; and Laſtly, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the gods according to the <hi>Myſſian</hi> rights, might not be impoſed abſolutely upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or condition: Theſe demands being ſent to the Senate by meſſengers of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much leſſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by any power whatſoever, began to thinke, that it would be now their ſafeſt way, rather for the preſent to endeavour to temper the Souldiers paſſions, then further either to tempt or hazzard their fury; To this purpoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back their meſſengers, with faithfull or at leaſtwiſe fained promiſes, that ſpeedily they ſhould receive ſatisfaction, according to their hearts content: Nevertheleſſe the Army finding after ſome weekes expectation, that the Senate endeavoured, rather to deceive their expectations by ſowing underhand and private factions among
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169951:89"/>the Souldiers, then that they intended really to performe in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after they had as it were choſen <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius</hi> as their Captaine Generall for their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as well as the Senate had choſen him for the Warres, not only ſeized preſently upon moſt of the Magazins of the Kingdome, but alſo ſent ſome Troopes to take the King out of priſon where he remained: <hi>Euarchus</hi> being a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this new and ſudden attempt, as he could not well interpret their meaning, although 'tis probable he might like well enough of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo at the firſt, did he make ſome ſtand at their proceedings; yet at laſt being perſwaded of their faire intentions, and having of the other ſide aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them of his affection, they inſtantly carried him in a certaine kinde of triumph through moſt part of the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> untill at laſt they lodged him in a brave Caſtle of his own, where he now remaines (as it is believed) with a great deale of ſatisfaction; And the rather, for that (it being ſo given out) they doe not only in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner, ſuffer him to exerciſe his own rights concerning the worſhip of the gods, with a free admittance of all companies to be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with what converſation he pleaſeth, but have lately envited him to ſend for the Queene and all his children, who ſhall be as they ſay joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes of his being againe eſtabliſhed in his Throne and dignity: and however they be ſomething ſuſpitious of the practiſes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> and thoſe belonging to that faction, leaſt they might perſwade the Kings heart
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169951:89"/>from the intereſt of the Souldiers, yet the better to give him ſatisfaction, concerning the opinion of his own liberty; neither they or any elſe are debarred either from his preſence or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whilſt of every ſide they have promiſed the common people a happineſſe according to their expectations, both in their manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the gods, as well as belonging to all other priviledges, that can poſſibly any way appertaine unto their future condition: which in truth I muſt tell you was the only occaſion of our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this day; Not only to thanke the gods in the generall for this appearing happy change, but alſo a little to exerciſe their ancient decorums in their rurall ſports, in regard they had been for ſome time debarred from ſuch ſports, by the rigid ſeverity of the <hi>Myſſian</hi> cuſtomes; which as I told you have been brought into <hi>Lydia,</hi> by the Prieſts and others of that Nation, that at laſt was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the people, as an abſolute injunction by the authority of the Senate: This being what I can ſay for your ſatisfaction, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affaires of the Kingdome, wherein I feare me I have too much offended in the generall by my long diſcourſes, though upon the matter I do not ſee how they could have been well omitted in any particular, ſo I hope you will now give me leave to end. After that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had thanked him for the paines he had taken, and the favour himſelfe had received, (having paſt away ſome time longer in other diſcourſes upon the ſame ſubject) the Prieſt calling his boy to take the lights, he conducted <hi>Narciſſus</hi> into his chamber,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169951:90"/>where after a while, with ſome Court-comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he left him to take his reſt, promiſing in the morning to ſhew him the Liberary, as one of the beſt curioſities he could preſent him withall.</p>
            <p>It was not very early the next morning, that the Prieſt interrupted <hi>Naroiſſus,</hi> conceiving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that his travell required ſomething more then ordinary reſt, though in that he was much deceived; for he was not accuſtomed to let paſſe much time, without thinking upon his deere <hi>Cloria:</hi> when he came into his chamber, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him, according to his promiſe to the ſight of his Library. As in that place they turned over many books of divers kinds, ſo beholding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, Maps and Spheares of the world, they fell in divers diſcourſes concerning the opinions of ſome in the Primitive age, that did not believe there were any <hi>Antipodes;</hi> as alſo, others again, that thought the Sunne ſtood ſtill, and the earth turned round; beſides, a third ſort of people which would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave occaſion to the old Prieſt to ſay, that as he would not much trouble his thoughts with the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe queſtions, ſince it could no way concerne either his preſent or future being, ſo was it an unanſwerable argument for the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule, that the Sun being of ſo vaſt a greatneſſe, &amp; of ſo excellent a clarity, no way to be known or imagined, of what matter it was made of, could not in all reaſon but be created for a thing more worthy then it ſelf; &amp; that not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169951:90"/>in this world, of neceſſity it muſt be the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable ſoul of man, and nothing elſe, which was at firſt ordained to be the object of ſuch an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard that onely remaining here, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to eternity, and ſo conſequently more worthy then all other things. From this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they fell to a diſputation about the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Armes and Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eſteem: <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſaid, that as action was more Noble then contemplation, ſince the one did but think what the other performed; ſo in probability arms was to be preferred before let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in that it created really the ſubject for the others imployment: beſides, he ſaid that action did not onely nouriſh it ſelfe, but gave life to other things, as namely Hiſtory, the worlds looking-glaſſe, and times recorder: againe, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he ſaid, was a means to warme mens apprehenſions, and deſires with Noble flames; whilſt Learning, in a more obſcure way, did but hold it the beſt honour it could merit from poſterity, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber truly what other people did worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; however perhaps it ſelfe was onely contented to lie drowned in a certain kind of ſenſuality, pleaſed with an imagination, that coveted but to know thoſe things perfectly, which it never intended at all to practiſe; ſince the dignity of Crowne and Empires depended not upon the information of who poſſeſſed them, but in having the free diſpoſe of ſuch glories themſelves, for the moſt part not to be compaſſed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169951:91"/>and enjoyed, but by active valour; when as books did no otherwiſe then make relation of thoſe paſſages, like Generals in triumphant Chariots after the battel, ſhewing to the people what was deſerved in the field; or rather repreſenting an excellent Comedian, appareld in moſt glorious attire, that playes to the life without wounds, the part of him that acted nobly and dangerouſly againſt his enemy. Books I muſt confeſſe, ſaid he, are commodious pictures, to teach preſent times by predeceſſors examples, what men ought to doe in their own perſons; whereas by activity and armes, we are put in poſſeſſion of the honour it ſelfe: The one, as I may ſay, being onely the ſhadow, that may in ſome ſort ſatisfie a ſoule not ſufficiently knowing or inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old ſtories in their youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpoſe: whereas the other continues us enjoying our own vertues, like a plentifull and flouriſhing Harveſt, producing variety of new fruit to the induſtrious Husbandman. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that Letters were onely uſefull in ſeaſons of quiet, whereas armes could onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and protect learning at all times, to make it become profitable, for that mens unruly and prepoſterous courſes, and actions were to be reſtrained and regulated, more by power then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. This being ſaid, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſmile, gave the Prieſt alſo occaſion to ſhew his reaſons.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt told him, as he hoped without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he would give him leave to be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169951:91"/>opinion, however he honoured ſufficiently the profeſſion of armes, ſo with a courteous ſmile he began the queſtion alſo in this manner: although I will not deny, ſaid he, but my ſelfe to have been a ſouldier in my youth, yet I cannot but ſtand for the priviledge of the pen, according to reaſon and juſtice; wherefore as contemplation doth not deſtroy the exerciſe of the body, ſo of the other ſide, books render a man more capable to act with advantage, without which attempts would not be much profitable, ſince mans life is too little a ſpace to learne ſufficiently, what were beſt to be done in many things: he ſaid further, that Military diſcipline it ſelfe, could not ſubſiſt to any prevailing purpoſe, without thoſe rules and orders which were before thought upon, and learned by method and inſtruction; for that it is not onely the running precipitately into haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and dangers, that ought to render a perſon deſervedly admired, though ſometimes blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fortune, crowne the action or attempt with ſucceſſe; but rather when as by a knowing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, we have either prevented a miſchiefe or procured a victory, deſerves eſtimation: A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and valiant Generall, ſaid he, goeth not ſo much into the field to hazzard and deſtroy, as to preſerve and overcome; which certainly cannot be ſo well effected, as by leaſt ſlaughter, and moſt policy; for although Monarchies and Countries are oftentimes conquered by force of armes and power, yet ſeldome without ſtratagems and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can they be long &amp; quietly enjoyed, for want of good eſtabliſhed lawes to maintaine them in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169951:92"/>peace and ſecurity; Warres he affirmed reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled furious windes and ſtormes that overthrow buildings, and productions, but order and quiet like good builders or provident husbandmen, make up againe the breaches to faireneſſe and commodity: even as a rough and harſh hand may quickly diſorder the ſtrings of inſtruments for want of ſufficient skill, but it muſt be skilfull Artiſts that makes them ſound delightfull to the eare: A diſorderly commonwealth ſaid he, may ſometimes neceſſarily be chaſtized with the ſword, as dangerous putrifactions, which are to be cut away from the reſt of the members, to ſave the whole body from periſhing; yet good and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government muſt be alwayes applyed as a ſalve to render the reſt againe whole and ſound: in concluſion, ſaid the Prieſt, a State or Kingdom may ſtand without Warre, but without learning it cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, ſince armies themſelves that are eſteemed the very inſtruments of glorious acquiſitions, muſt, to preſerve their own being, much more to purchaſe them conſiderable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, be obliged punctually to obſerve thoſe rules preſcribed them in times of peace: To this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>Narciſſus</hi> only replyed, ſince he had ſo well defended learning by learning, he had no reaſon any more to endeavour by the ſharp lauguage of his tongue to deſtroy the excellency of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like diſcourſes at laſt carrying them to dinner; which being finiſhed and the cloth taken away, of a ſudden the Prieſt was whiſpered in the eare by the little youth: <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> civilly removed from his place to give them
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169951:92"/>the more freedome of ſpeaking: when he had done, the Prieſt told him that he was ſent for by one <hi>Creſes,</hi> a young Nobleman of <hi>Lydia,</hi> unto whom he had been formerly beholding, not only for the ſaving of his Library, but for many other courteſies, during his being imployed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates ſervice; who was juſt now (being come out of <hi>Syria</hi>) arrived in the Towne hard by, from whom he doubted not as he ſaid but to have ſome relations of conſequence, to which purpoſe he did intend to bring him along with him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: He farther enformed him, that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoyned him to write the paſſages of theſe Times which gave his ſtudies ſome daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: with this he took his leave of <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> wiſhing him to thinke upon what imployment he pleaſed in the interim, either in his gardens or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his bookes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Narciſſus</hi> after the Prieſt was gone, as he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Creſes</hi> arrivall, who might bring newes out of <hi>Syria</hi> as he hoped towards the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Euarchus</hi> in his Throne, by which conſequence he doubted not, but the ſooner to come to the period of his own love, ſo of the other ſide did he reſolve, upon his quitting ſuddenly the Prieſts houſe, to put himſelfe underthe command of the revolted Army, not knowing which other way to doe his ſweet Princeſſe any conſiderable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; eſpecially for that the King her father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med now to be only under the care and protection of the Souldiers: The next conſideration that came into his minde was, by what meanes he might with the leaſt ſuſpition provide himſelfe

            <p>The Dukes daughter of that Countrey named <hi>Eretheria,</hi> one day walking by chance by the Sea ſide with one attendant onely, neer a certaine kinde of religious houſe where ſhe was retired for her devotions, of a ſudden caſting down her eyes towards the bottome of the rocks, ſhe might ſee ſomething lye, that however ſo farre off ſhe could not perfectly diſtinguiſh; Nevertheleſſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her lookes fixed for ſome time upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which ſhe thought according to the fancies of her imagination, not only to be a body that had been caſt up by the Sea, but that it alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have ſome motion in it: ſo that there being in that place certaine ſteps cut in the ſtone, that afforded conveniency enough for deſcent, ſhe reſolved her ſelfe in perſon to make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169951:94"/>whereby the better to ſatisfie her curioſity: where being arrived with her maid ſervant, ſhe ſoon perceived a handſome young man lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſands, with a piece of round Timber un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his body, as it were infolded within one of his armes, whilſt the other lay at ſome diſtance: This proſpect however it ſomething ſtartled her thoughts, with a little kinde of horrour, yet her courage more prevailing then the naturall feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of her ſex, as ſhe approached neerer, the youth ſeemed to have ſome motion, and this gave both her apprehenſion and charity a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as ſhe thought to work upon: wherefore preſently ſending her attendant to call ſome Fiſhermen at a prety diſtance that were mending their Nets, ſhe cauſed them preſently to tranſport the youth to a ſmall houſe by the water ſide, who in the interim began to recover more and more life: To be ſhort, within a while ſhe applyed ſo many remedies with her faire hands to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, that in a few dayes he recovered from the greateſt part of his danger, though not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the troubleſomeneſſe of his ſickneſſe; which kept him in his bed for a very long ſeaſon, though in a manner daily viſited by the faire and charitable <hi>Eretheria;</hi> not yet having yielded an account to any of the accident by Sea, that was the occaſion of his being caſt in that ſort upon the ſhoare: But finding at laſt, that he not only had gained a competent ſtrength for what expreſſion ſoever, but alſo that that faculty reſtored to him was at preſent neceſſary to be uſed for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, one day when <hi>Eretheria</hi> came according to

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169951:97"/>I left the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> providing not only for the Nuptials of the young couple, but for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the old Duke: whilſt my occaſions and paſſions carried me after the Queene <hi>Hyacinthia</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> being thither retired as I heard after the death of <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> who during his life had abſolutely obſtructed her paſſage and intention: where being no ſooner arrived, but as the world had bin turned into nothing but wonders, I found alſo <hi>Orſames</hi> dead, and his Queen newly brought abed of two ſonnes, which afforded the Kingdom of <hi>Syria</hi> an equall ſhare both of joy and ſorrow: This notwithſtanding ſo farre protracted my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, that as I had but little conveniency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the State of our <hi>Lydian</hi> affaires to <hi>Hyacinthia</hi> with all the particulars concerning the Princeſſe <hi>Clorias</hi> fortunes, ſo had ſhe leſſe hope her ſelfe to determine of any thing ſpeedily, in regard of the unſettlement of buſineſſes and governments in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe new changes that had ſo lately hapned: ſo that for ſome time I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to quit the City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire my ſelfe to a more private place of habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, finding at Court how unwilling they were to entertaine any occaſion of charge and expence; the rather for that Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> the Kings el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne, was only to be furniſhed out of his mothers penſion and allowance: but long I had not continued in my voluntary retirement, but ſudden intelligence was brought to Court, not onely of the generall revolt of the Senate of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> Army from their ſervice, but alſo that it was reported they had taken King <hi>Euarchus</hi> out of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169951:97"/>Priſon into the Souldiers protection: as this gave all our thoughts, freſh hopes of ſomething ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to be acted for his good and reſtoration, ſo am I at preſent ſent to him with Letters from the Queen, though to what effectuall purpoſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, for that I find not only her ſelfe, but the whole State of <hi>Syria</hi> to be extreamely addicted to the <hi>Myſſian</hi> intereſt, which as I ſuppoſe the Army will never willingly conſent unto, in regard they have already ſo publickly and violently declared to the contrary; having made it the chiefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the quarrell between them and the Senate, which in effect is all I can ſay either of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or imployment: Then turning himſelfe to the Prieſt he told him, that he muſt intreat his company to Court: and this preſently carried them all three to ſupper.</p>
            <p>When they had ended, the Prieſt told <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> that although he feared his occaſions would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him for the preſent to take a journey to Court, whereby to have the happineſſe againe to ſee his old maſter the King, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not to be longer in a capacity, to doe him that farther ſervice in his own houſe he deſired, yet he hoped they ſhould have the honour of his company along with them, where he durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his reception ſhould be equall with either of theirs, in thoſe contents they ſhould receive by ſo fortunate an occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Narciſſus</hi> after he had thanked him, as well for his paſt favours as his preſent offers, aſſured him that as he could not but be extreamely joyfull at the opportunity he ſhould have by that voyage,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169951:98"/>againe to behold his great maſter in ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being reſtored to his ancient right and dignity, ſo did he wiſh him unfainedly to believe, that notwithſtanding he could moſt willingly participate of his good luck in perſonally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them to Court, whereby to be an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their entertainments, yet ſuch were his preſſing occaſions (eſpecially in regard of thoſe accidents that had lately hapned in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi>) that he was obliged to make what haſt he could poſſible into his own Countrey, where notwithſtanding he ſhould ſtudy what requitals he ſhould be any way able to performe in lieu of thoſe civillities he had received by his meanes in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia:</hi> Theſe complements with other diſcourſes continued them in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, untill the time of the night cauſed them all to retire into their ſeverall lodgings: and the rather was the haſt more neceſſary, for that the Prieſt was to make ſome convenient preparation for the next dayes journey.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was come into his chamber, and being there onely accompanied by his folita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts, inſtead of ſleep he fell upon theſe melancholly conſiderations: Firſt it came into his minde, that he had not alone loſt a deare and loving father, whoſe wiſedome would have been a continuall ſupport unto him in all his difficult affaires, but by that unreparable loſſe, he was alſo in danger to be deprived of the beſt part of his eſteemed hereditary honour, and command, by the marriage of his ſiſter with <hi>Eumenes,</hi> fince in his roome he was elected chiefe governour of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169951:98"/>Countrey, in regard of the generall opinion was amongſt the people of his death: yet againe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this poſſeſſion, he had ſome hopes by the affection of the Inhabitants to be reſtored to his right, when they ſhould by his perſonall appearance, be made fully acquainted with the miſtake of his death without either bloud or trouble, ſince as he doubted not of the naturall affection of his ſiſter <hi>Eretheria,</hi> ſo would he not ſuſpect the noble diſpoſition of <hi>Eumenes:</hi> but when he reflected upon the luſtre and ſweetneſſe of Crownes and Dignities, being once enjoyed either by ambitious and high ſpirits, he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there might be more difficulty in the attempt then ordinary, and ſo conſequently an occaſion given of contention and ſlaughter, not poſſible to be ended between them without deſtruction to one or other: beſides he doubted for the preſent which ſeemed moſt to trouble him, that theſe ſudden changes, might ſo far alienate the thoughts and affections of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> from his parsicular, that ſhe might be induced in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, to entertaine the addreſſes of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> that were moſt violently as he knew propoſed to her choyce by the powerfull Senate of <hi>Lydia;</hi> And as he imagined would be the ſooner entertained, in regard of the King her fathers preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who by that meanes might hope the eaſier to come to the poſſeſſion of his rights, eſpecially when all opportunities were afforded, either for courtſhips or ſolicitation; and probably could not long be reſiſted, by reaſon of her conſtrained condition, that obliged her without prevention,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169951:99"/>to endure all aſſaults and affronts to that purpoſe, that ſhould from time to time be attempted upon her perſon: As theſe laſt conſiderations moſt ſtrugled inwardly with his uncertaine thoughts, not knowing well whether he ſhould leave <hi>Lydia</hi> or not, ſo did he begin to thinke, that there being no Army in the Field that was in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to <hi>Clorias</hi> preſence, it would be too little purpoſe longer to continue in the Kingdome; and therefore reſolved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to goe for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> where he ſeemed not to doubt, but that the people (if not <hi>Eumenes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) finding him alive contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſoon be perſwaded to reaſon in his behalfe: And to this purpoſe being ſetled in his fathers command, he ſhould be not only able to bring aſſiſtance to King <hi>Euarchus</hi> occafions, but alſo contribute much to his dangers releaſement; whereas the contrary would both confirme the opinion of his being dead, and in ſome ſort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe of too much ſloath in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for not appearing activer in thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own that belonged ſo exceedingly to his honour and welfare: with theſe reſolutions he quickly fell aſleep.</p>
            <p>In the morning the old Prieſt came to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to take his leave with theſe complements, that as he had hitherto been aſhamed, that his own diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to render him thoſe ſervices due to his worth, had made him want he feared ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as was fitting in his poore habitation, and much more ſince he was now forced to leave him by the accidentall journey, he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169951:99"/>to make to Court in the company of <hi>Creſes,</hi> ſo if he pleaſed to deſigne any longer ſtay in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> he ſhould take it for ſome part of ſatisfaction to his fortunes, that he would reſolve to make uſe of his houſe in his abſence, a place ſhould be alwayes ready he aſſured him, to afford him the beſt conveniency it was able for his aboade: which he refuſing with the like comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they both preſently deſcended into the Hall, where they found <hi>Creſes</hi> ready prepared to take horſe: After they had eate a bit or two, and performed ſome other few ceremonies belonging to their departure, they quickly mounted their Steads.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt and <hi>Creſes</hi> had not travelled many Furlongs together, ere they met with a moſt even and direct path way; and that commodity as it ſhould ſeem invited them both to a new diſcourſe, ſince the Prieſt ſeemed extreamely unſatisfied as yet, why the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> and much more the Queen <hi>Hyacinthia,</hi> ſhould be ſo unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a correſpondency with the Army, that had delivered the perſon of <hi>Euarchus</hi> out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though paſſionately deſirous to retaine an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> that had apparantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him thither, according to the common opinion almoſt of all <hi>Aſia.</hi>

            <p>Father, ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> as I have already made unto you a relation of my voyage into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with ſome part of my proceedings in <hi>Syria,</hi> ſo having for the preſent ſo faire an opportunity, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to let you know my thoughts, in many other particulars that I have not yet mentioned:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169951:100"/>To this purpoſe you muſt underſtand, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the people of the Iſland of <hi>Crete,</hi> ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame worſhip of the gods with the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> yet cannot they obtaine the free exerciſe of their religion, either from King <hi>Euarchus</hi> or his Queen <hi>Hyacinthia:</hi> though <hi>Euarchus</hi> by the Court of <hi>Syria</hi> hath been preſt not onely to ſigne all the chiefe articles of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> but alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſubſcribe to their tenents in matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, notwithſtanding they be altogether deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Kingly rule or the religion of <hi>Syria:</hi> As this gives me not ſo much encouragement in my journey as I could wiſh, in regard the Souldiers will not be willing to allow of any intereſt but their own, towards the placing of the King again in his Throne, ſo the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> as I heare, are extreamly buſie about the Kings perſon, to the no ſmall diſcontentment of the army, that hath him now under their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: the Queen when I parted from her at <hi>Damaſcrs</hi> gave me expreſſe order, that however I might complement with the Souldiers, and draw from them all the advantages that poſſibly I could, tending to her husbands ſervice, yet I muſt be ſure as ſhe told me in the firſt place, to poſſeſſe the <hi>Myſſians</hi> with an opinion, that <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> chiefe truſt muſt ſtill reſt in their fidelities and aſſiſtance, though he be forced for the preſent to comply with the Army, that delivered him out of the hands of the Senate: but here I make no doubt but you will aske me why the State of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> much leſſe our Queen <hi>Hyacinthia,</hi> ſhould be ſo wedded to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> particular? when as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169951:100"/>probably they can never be brought, to be hearty in the Kings affaires, ſince not only in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe times they oppoſed his authority, with all the craft and violence they could poſſibly uſe, but at laſt as I may ſay delivered him betrayed and bound hand and foot, into the hands of thoſe that were eſteemed by himſelfe his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when as he had choſen for his protection, rather the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Army then the Senate of <hi>Lydia:</hi> And this expreſſion of ill nature and treachery, was only to obtaine the payment of a ſmall ſum of money, not to be valewed in regard of a Kings ranſome: ſo that I ſay it may be ſuppoſed, they have ſome other hidden myſtery in their thoughts againſt his proſperity, which perhaps the State of <hi>Syria</hi> wil never be able ſufficiently to underſtand, whilſt it be too late to repaire the Kings loſſes onely procured by thoſe people: for it is well knowne, during the time they gave <hi>Euarchus</hi> the beſt hopes concerning their affections and fidelity, they were then by their falſe inſtruments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting with the Senate for his ſpeedy impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a plaine demonſtration of their harſh and cruell intentions towards his particular; for that when they moſt betrayed him, they profeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then his faithfulleſt ſervants; as it were ſmothering him in a bed of roſes, and killing him with deceitfull language: whereas of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, theſe Souldiers that have not onely the Kings perſon, but his authority under their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; and ſo by conſequence may either ſhorten his life or preſerve his dignity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have heretofore alwayes declared
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169951:101"/>themſelves mortall enemies to his intereſt, and proceedings, as never having any dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court or his affaires, yet now appeare to the outward view of the world, to be his greateſt friends, either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compaſſionate and juſt in their diſpoſitions: which certainly cannot but extreamely augment the Kings obligations, if they performe any thing remarkable according to their profeſſions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the iſſue of their intentions or actions, ſo muſt I a little diſcourſe unto you, what may be the ſuppoſitions of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> State, that ſeemes ſo much to countenance the <hi>Myſſians</hi> before the Souldiers; and to ſay the plaine truth doe more favour them then any other people, that have ſeemed moſt affectionate towards the Kings intereſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt you may ſuppoſe, that they thinke the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> not onely in regard that moſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Nobility, have either command or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the Army or Warres of <hi>Syria,</hi> but the common people and inferiour ſort, have ſuch a dependency upon the Nation, by reaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine priviledges granted them time out of mind, by way of a free Trade and commerce amongſt them, that it is unpoſſible for them to quit their intereſt, for any other benefit that can be propoſed to their conſideration: And the rather for that the Court maintaines alwayes ſome Ambaſſadour or Agent in their Countrey, both to direct their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſignes, and to inform the State upon all occaſions of their proceedings; which joyned
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169951:101"/>with the large pentions are beſtowed amongſt their rulers, and other eminent perſons of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> will prove as they believe neceſſary ties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to retaine their fidelities conſtant to the <hi>Syrian</hi> ends; And ſo conſequently can they never attempt the deſtroying or leſſening of Monarchy, but as they ſhall direct and approve of: beſides moſt of the factions now prevailing againſt <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> authority in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> are compoſed either of Lords or Prieſts, who are moſt commonly not ſo envious to royalty (or at leaſtwiſe as they may believe more to be perſwaded by reaſon) then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant people, that have learned no rules ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to government and order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not ſo much to be feared in their courſes and prevailing juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they ſhould be ſuffered ſomething too much to proſper in either proceedings againſt their King: Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the generall, is a great deale more conducing to the commodity of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> then a common government, either in <hi>Lydia</hi> or <hi>Myſſia;</hi> and therefore not probable they ſhould joyne in ſuch a ſtrict amity with the Senate, as abſolutely to deſtroy the prerogative, and Kingly juriſdiction of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> ſince by that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongſt the Nobility and perſons of greateſt quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit from other Princes abroad in their occaſions: and whereas many may be perſwaded to believe, that by agreeing in thoſe deſignes, for the abſolute overthrowing of Monarchy in <hi>Lydia,</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:169951:102"/>they might in time come to be equall ſharers in the government of both Kingdomes; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently participate alike in the profit and gain, being the chiefe (if not the onely) thing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous diſpoſitions looke after, ſuch thoughts are meere fancies and chymeras: for certainly the Senate underſtanding well the poorneſſe of the Country of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> and not being ignorant of the ſecret intentions of the people, withall how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be ſure to take order, they ſhall have no more intereſt in the affaires of <hi>Lydia,</hi> then is intirely neceſſary for their own ſervice and commodity: ſo that when the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſhall find their aymes to faile in theſe particulars, it is to be imagined that they will not onely be perſwaded, upon the leaſt endeavour of the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> to fall off from the <hi>Lydian</hi> faction, but even to make a War with that Nation it ſelfe, for the eſtabliſhing againe of their King in his ancient glory and command; and to that effect adhere either to <hi>Syria</hi> or any other Nation that may aſſiſt them in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: onely this doubt in ſome ſort may be made, that <hi>Argilius</hi> and <hi>Lycius,</hi> who ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily have betrayed the Kings perſon for a ſum of money, will never by their good wills truſt themſelves any more under his power, for feare of revenge anſwerable to their deſerts; And they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt principall men of the Countrey, it is to be ſuſpected, they will have ſo great power and influence, over the actions and determinations of the reſt of the Inhabitans in the generall, that they can never be brought in any kind to own the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169951:102"/>Kings intereſt to purpoſe, notwithſtanding all the labour and induſtry of the Kingdome of <hi>Syria:</hi> But to this I ſhall only make this anſwer, that however theſe people prevailed in the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for the ſelling of the Kings perſon, againſt the thoughts and wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, hath procured them ſince ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in their own Country, that it may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be believed by the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> there muſt of neceſſity ariſe daily new factions amongſt them, neither want they intelligence at the preſent, that aſſures them that an Army will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly march into <hi>Lydia</hi> from <hi>Myſſia,</hi> in King <hi>Euarchus</hi> behalf: which advertizement I ſuppoſe is ſent, them by their Ambaſſadour there remaining: Laſt of all I may adde that the Court of <hi>Syria</hi> may imagine, the Souldiers who have now the King in their poſſeſſion, having no other relation but to their own wills and uncertaine principles, will prove from time to time as inconſtant in their reſolutions, as they have been heretofore deſperate in their fortunes, and be rather in the generall inclinable to affect equality, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long contented to be governed by Kingly authority, or to ſay the plaine truth willing to be under any juriſdiction whatſoever; witneſſe their falling off from their command both under the Senate and their old Generall: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is eſteemed a maxime among their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, to have ſcarce dependency upon any power, neither in thoſe things that belong to the gods worſhip, or concerning other their humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pretending by ſuch conſtraint, an abſolute
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169951:103"/>freedome cannot be enjoyed, either in minde or body; ſo that however the King may ſeem a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to revive by their proceedings, yet I can aſſure you in <hi>Syria,</hi> there is a great doubt made of the reality of their actions: but whether theſe opinions be grounded, either upon the perſwaſions of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> or upon other more ſolid though ſecret reaſons, I will not take upon me at preſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but rather ſhall expect, both with hope and patience the iſſue, in the interim apply my ſelfe to my direction and commiſſion, as well in keeping a correſpondency with the Souldiers as with the <hi>Myſſians:</hi> by this time again the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſomething uneven, ſo that they could not well proſecute any farther diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>At night they tooke up their lodging; not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove halfe a dayes journey where the King remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not much farther diſtant from the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where encountering with a jovial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion maſter of the houſe, as appearing alſo faithfull to <hi>Euarchus</hi> in his intentions, after they had accommodated themſelves to their minds in their chambers, they deſired their hoſt with an equall indifference to let them underſtand, as well the newes that concerned the proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army, ſince as they ſaid, they could not chuſe, but be of a nature ſomething more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then ordinary, in regard of the late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of both parties, which ſeemed at preſent to put moſt of the Kingdome to a kind of a vaſt conſideration concerning the iſſue: the rather were they curious of this information, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169951:103"/>thereby to taſt the inclinations of the people.</p>
            <p>Truly gentlemen, ſaid the Hoſt, as I muſt not take upon me the underſtanding of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not very well acquainted with their own intentions themſelves, ſo ſhall I to ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enforme you if you pleaſe, of thoſe diſcourſes that have lately paſſed in the Senate, concerning the Kings government, notwithſtanding the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have him perſonally at the preſent under their juriſdiction; who to ſay the plaine truth, uſe him with that civility and reſpect, that it gives his friends more then ordinary hopes, of his ſpeedy reſtoration againe to the honour of his Crowns and Dignity; however the gods onely know what the iſſue of their determinations may be: ſome of the Senate would have no King at all, pretending that it would be too miſerable a condition for all ſorts of people, to be Subject both in their perſons and eſtates to an entire Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, not ſuffering them ſo much as to aske a reaſon concerning any thing that ſhould be done amiſſe, although their purſes and paines were forced, upon all occaſions to pay for the honour, and the pride belonging to the dignity: whereas a common government as they ſay, gives a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of encouragement pleaſing, in ſome kinde or other to all ſorts of people, as having an appropriated ſhare in every action, that concerned the good or ill of the Commonwealth: others againe of a contrary ſpirit pretended, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that if the government ſhould be abſolutely changed to a popular State, though it might
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169951:104"/>ſeem in outward appearance, to have more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it could not nevertheleſſe but be of leſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in that it would be alwayes Subject to faction and confuſion, in regard of the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of diſpoſitions, and therefore are rather of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the government remaine in the ſame nature as it doth, with ſome neceſſary reſtrictions to their King: A third ſort made ſome doubt, how to finde out wayes to limite a Monarch in any kinde, by what lawes ſoever could be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to that purpoſe, it being almoſt impoſſible to take from a Prince altogether the ſword of Juſtice &amp; power, and yet ſuffer him ſtill to remain in the condition of a governour; which in effect would be no other, then a common government var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving the whole as ſubject to faction and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if there were no King at all; in that he ſhould want the authority, although he were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the name neceſſary to that purpoſe: there were others that ſuddenly ſtarted up in the Senate-houſe, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all inconveniences; which was to have onely a King by election, either of <hi>Euarchus</hi> family or ſome other: but the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was quickly anſwered with theſe doubts: that if the Prince intended, ſhould be elected out of the ſame bloud, if not according to the direct line of ſucceſſion, it would endanger a new ſlaughter and faction, through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by reaſon of ſeverall ambitious intereſts; of the other ſide, if he were abſolutely choſen out of another family, as no doubt but there would
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169951:104"/>be many oppoſers, in the very election it ſelfe, ſo not poſſible to have any, of an extraction illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burthen to the Commonwealth in their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſupport; which probably would prove a ſufficient inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes juſtice would be ſold, &amp; other oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions committed, only to ſupply a needy and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent family: in concluſion, however many ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med willing againe to reſtore <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and his poſterity to their ancient rights and dignity, yet fearing in regard of their own proceedings, that they might be ſtrictly called in queſtion for their paſt actians, they utterly deſiſted from that reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: &amp; notwithſtanding theſe ſeverall and violent diſcourſes, for that time they ſetled upon no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination whatſoever; only at laſt they ordered, the government ſhould remaine as it was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Senates power, though bearing ſtill the name of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> until farther confideration: I muſt tell you, as theſe were the manner of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Councels at <hi>Sardis,</hi> both before and ſince the revolt of the Army, ſo now by their favours as we ſuppoſe, they muſt aske leave of the Souldiers, before they ſettle either a government in themſelves, or take it away from others; And the rather am I induced to this beliefe, for that the common people, appeare not yet much ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at the late revolt; but of the contrary, as tis thought, would be extreamely ſatisfied with the Souldiers proceedings, if they ſhould ſpeedily againe turne the ſtreame into its right courſe; however in that I ſhall ſay the leaſt that may be,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169951:105"/>untill I be more inſtructed in the conſtitution of the world: with theſe words he ended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and preſently tooke his leave; pretending ſome other company in his houſe, needed alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of his entertainment.</p>
            <p>This information of the Hoſt, gave <hi>Creſes</hi> and the Prieſt occaſion, to fall into a more ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, concerning the nature and property of Monarchy and other governments, according to divers opinions and judgements, with the ſeverall benefits and inconveniences belonging to them: The Prieſt would needs take upon him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingly part; whilſt <hi>Creſes</hi> was to be content with the more inferiour degree: both notwithſtanding grounding their diſcourſes, from the hopes they had, that the Souldiers would ſhortly againe reſtore <hi>Euarchus</hi> to his Crowne and government: The Prieſt firſt began in this manner:</p>
            <p>As Monarchy in the generall, ſaid he, hath been held by writers, to be the beſt and moſt abſolute way of government, ſo ought it as well be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a Prince by deſcent and inheritance, is the freeſt of all others from burthen and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to the people; ſince the making up of new families upon every exchange, and the many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous factions would ariſe by reaſon of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would at one time or other, either hazzard or ruine the Commonwealth; for that all ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, could never be ſuppreſt totally in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the only conſideration of the common ſafety: but that I may more particularly make good my argument, I ſhall endeavour from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169951:105"/>principles of Divinity, nature, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the firſt place according to the example of the divine providence, there is but one God that made and now rules the heavens, ſince if there were more, none could be abſolute, much leſſe omnipotent in any kinde, and ſo conſequently the government, ſhould ſtill be ſubject to variation, both in part and in the whole; for as divers perſons muſt have ſeverall wills, ſo that of neceſſity, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found commands and diſtract obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by executions, could not chuſe but be protracted to the rending of all actions and endeavours, of no conſiderable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the world: wherefore we ſee, ſubordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by this great and all powerfull God; every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct orbe being ſo involved one within another, untill they all become governed by the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, onely to avoyd equality and confuſion: ſo that we may eaſily perceive by that decorum, that there is an entire neceſſity of one governour: As for example, there is but one Sun that governes the day, as another light ſhines in the night, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which being accompanied with any of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall authority or influence; as it were both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, to a certaine manner of abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in their ſeverall kinds of motion and luſtre: in the ſecond place, by the very rules of nature we have experience, that ſome one in every ſpecies pretends above the reſt to dominion and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: as for the purpoſe, the induſtrious and painfull Commonwealth of the Bees, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169951:106"/>one to goe before them, whoſe perſon and voyce they onely obey and follow, with a ſeeming care and extraordinary obedience: The ſilly Ants in like manner, have their Prince amongſt them, who ſeemes by his abſolute authority, only to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne and direct their labours, tending to unity and benefit in their ſmall and innocent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal'h: ſo that theſe being creatures no way gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to exorbitancy of will as men are, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to have but one governour, much more for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and regulated in our diſpoſitions; which certainely cannot long be without the authority of ſome ſingle power, that muſt not be equalled or contracted by any other: we ſee if two ſtrange Bulls be but turned looſe together in any paſture, their contention one with another never ends, whilſt one of the two have gained the abſolute maſtery over the other: with what extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the game, perſecute one another in bloud &amp; wounds, untill the one of them have obtained the victory by the others death and ruine? Ney example me if you can, any two Males of any generous kinde whatſoever, that will endure the others ſociety, without an abſolute ſubjection to his power and courage; as it were never but ſtriving till one have procured the entire juriſdiction of the place; as if nature by no meanes could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are ſeemingly contented with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169951:106"/>the ſociety, and company of their fellowes: which ſhews in my opinion a certaine kinde of neceſſity in all governments of one onely Monarch, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid faction and confuſion, but to unite deſires and induſtry, towards the welfare and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of any Commonwealth; ſince without ſuch a knowne power and command, it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to bridle and keep in order at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant deſires of mankind: whoſe very nature or inclination, doth ſwell as it were with nothing but appetites of contention: Laſtly concerning the very inſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon earth: the firſt certainly was Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; for as in the beginning a man in his own private family, appeared to be the onely abſolute Prince to be obeyed, ſo dominions and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, became no other way eſtabliſhed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the world, but by the uniting together of ſeverall houſholds, either by accident or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; And though ſometimes people meerly out of neceſſity, to keep themſelves the better in peace and quietneſſe, were forced to chuſe and forme commonwealths, yet we ſcarce read of any juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be enterteined (at leaſtwiſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for any conſiderable ſpace) but where one ſingle power chiefly if not abſolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the meere dictates of reaſon, without any manner of ſcience or experience, were conſtrained to believe, that no other government could be ſafe and laſting; however their Lords not ſeldome proved the cruelleſt Tyrants could be imagined: as I cannot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169951:107"/>deny, but by reaſon of the exorbitancy of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and wicked Princes, a State hath beene changed from a private to a popular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or government; yet ſcarce did I ever heare of any, but that both began and ended in Kingly authority; as being ſtill by ſome accident or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſtrained to that election or converſion, either in abſolute power, or mixt repreſentation, as if ſome kinde of neceſſity, required ſuch an eſtabliſhment to render it laſting, and convenient to the people.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> it is a moſt miſerable condition for the people, to be in a continuall ſubjection, under the power and command of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an impotent or an exorbitant Prince; for though he ſhould know what were beſt to be done, yet his perverſe nature and diſpoſition, would not ſuffer him to put it in execution. And if he knew not how to governe, he becomes led by the pride and covetouſneſſe of others: Again, put the caſe government might fall into the hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the people might in any kinde have the leaſt hope of redreſſe? ſince by the Lawes and rules of inheritance, he were to continue ſtill without prevention and obſtacle; which of neceſſity ſometime or other would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; &amp; conſequently caſt the government into the hands of ſuch as he ſhould chuſe, that probably were not farre from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it muſt be the ſame during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that meanes rendred altogether uncapable either of governing himſelf or others.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:169951:107"/>
            <p>Tis true anſwered the Prieſt, the misfortune to a Kingdome is not ſmall when either of theſe happen: but however as no private intereſt can be ſo deſtroying as generall confuſion, ſo can it not be but much ſafer for a Commonwealth, to be under the juriſdiction of one vicious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Prince (who tis likely will be glutted by his exceſſes, or may be aſſiſted in his Councels) then for it to be wholy governed by many diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing heads, and factious diſpoſitions, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſeverall wayes in their intentions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, which of neceſſity muſt diſtract all profitable determinations, and at the beſt cannot but protract, if not abſolutely hinder thoſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tending to peace and proſperity; being ſcarce to be avoyded in a common government, where opinions and intereſts are ſeverall in the rulers: beſides, it is well knowne that in ſuch Councels, ſecrets of the moſt higheſt nature (for that they are committed to many) are ſubject to be revealed if not betrayed.</p>
            <p>But according to my ſenſe and beliefe ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> ſuch a Magiſtracy might be created out of the whole, that when good and neceſſary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes were agreed upon, might eaſily governe with ſecrecy and moderation to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the people, who would be pleaſed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, in having the name of the election of ſuch Miniſters.</p>
            <p>If you meane ſaid the Prieſt, that this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhould be eternall, it were a great deale worſe and more dangerous in matters of Tyranny and injuſtice, then to be under one ſingle Pritce,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169951:108"/>by inheritance, ſince he might dye, and by that meanes, his ſucceſſor might againe bring eaſe and remedy, but the other aſſembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were unpoſſible ever to expect any redreſſe at all; for that thoſe that ſhould happen to ſucceed, would come to their places but one by one, and conſequently could not have voyces in number ſufficient to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile the opinions of the reſt, remaining in the Councell or Magiſtracy: beſides if any ſhould have received injury, or endured oppreſſion by the caſting voyces of the whole aſſembly, to whom ſhould he flye for remedy and redreſſe? ſince every one ſingly would put off the blame from himſelfe; pretending not to have authority and power ſufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repaire the injured perſon; which ſeldome or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or oppreſſed by a Prince, or any of his Officers or Miniſters of State, it would be no great difficulty, to make the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar complaint underſtood at one time or another to himſelfe; And more facile it would be a great deale, for the Monarch or governour ſpeedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that concerned his own perſon, or belonging to any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; for elſe he ſhould be forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world; whereas the others actions, (that is to ſay concerning the particular) would be ſo involved in the darke, that it were almoſt impoſſible to make it appeare where the fault lay but in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aſſembly; who without an infinite labour
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169951:108"/>could not be brought to underſtand, much leſſe to redreſſe the grievance: And if you meane this magiſtracy or ſupreame authority, ſhould be only temporary, and ſo conſequently be made ſubject upon all occaſions to the election and queſtioning of the common people: what a world of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences would it bring? not only by continuall factions and diſorders, in the chuſing theſe new Magiſtrates, but in the very ſpight and heartbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would be occaſioned thereby amongſt the people, being carried on to this election, by a certaine conceived greatneſſe in their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that might render their rude ambitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely unſatisfied, if they ſhould be at any time croſt in their choyce; with a thouſand other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that I cannot mention.</p>
            <p>Yet ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> alshough it ſhould be granted, that in thoſe particulars you have mentioned, Monarchy were to be eſteemed the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient government of all others; however it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that the common people are in that ſlavery under ſuch a juriſdiction, that they cannot poſſibly have hearts ſufficiently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to render them entirely induſtrious, towards the profit and good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the generall, in regard that however they toyle and take paines in abundance, they can never attaine to any places of dignity or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the Kingdome, either to content their thoughts or advance their eſteem; whereas in a popular ſtate, the meaneſt is in the ſame capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preferment, as the higheſt borne perſon in he Countrey.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:169951:109"/>
            <p>Although this be true ſaid the Prieſt; yet the defect proceeds not from their naturall unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but from their diſabillity or want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they will as well ſuffer in a popular government, as in a Kingly authority, ſince no worthy perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is debarred from preferment in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, if his induſtry and parts can merit the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advancement; and although he ſhould in any kinde miſſe of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him ſo much to be under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Nobility, that are by birth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction above his condition as to finde himſelfe much ſubordinate and inferiour, to thoſe of his own ranke and quallity: to be eſteemed of all others moſt irkeſome to humane nature: ſo that you ſee it is but meere fancy, that engenders theſe conſiderations and opinions: beſides there are other inconveniences and omiſſions appertaining to a popular government; as for example, it ſeldome or never preferres or rewards worthy perſons according to their deſerts and merrits; when as for the moſt part ſmalleſt crimes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are puniſhed by moſt fearefull and horrid ſeverity; proceeding either from envy or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which is the occaſion that oftentimes, when Generalls, Commanders, or States men have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſufficient intereſt and eſteeme amongſt all ſorts of people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own ſafeties from the Magiſtracy, they enter preſently into ſuch rebellions that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turne the Commonwealth into a Tyrannicall
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169951:109"/>Monarchy, or occaſion at the beſt ſo much bloud and ſlaughter, that every Subject thereof hath reaſon enough to feare his own loſſe, if not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſtruction; whereas a Prince being of ſo eminent a condition himſelfe, not to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any of what quallity ſoever, hath no cauſe to be envious or ſuſpicious: againe the Prince hath a more neere intereſt in his Countries good then all his ſubjects beſides by way of perſonall honour; wherefore a greater benefit or loſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him in every thing, that is acted, ſince he creates not only the officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes the profit or diſprofit of the ſucceſſe, whereas the people in a Commonwealth receive it but in the generall, no one man being able to appropriate any publike action particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to himſelfe; which is a principall motive to enduce the Prince to attend earneſtly the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the government, becauſe he may be ſaid truly to eſteeme it his own, which no other priſon can doe in what conſtitution ſome ever, if there be others in equall authority with him; for to joyne intereſts, will never take ſo much the fancy and opinion of the owners, as thoſe which are ſingly appertaining but to one onely.</p>
            <p>Well ſaid <hi>Creſes)</hi> although I ſee upon any termes you will needs have a Monarchy, to be the beſt government, yet nevertheleſſe I muſt not have a Prince altogether unlimited, as it were threatning a kinde of a fearefull apprehenſion of Tyranny to his people; by which meanes they would be hindred from endeavouring induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, either the common good or their private
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169951:110"/>welfare: but rather I ſhould wiſh a king, in ſome ſort bound by lawes fundamentall, eſtabliſhed by a lawdable conſtitution at the firſt; however not to be ſo ſtrictly chayned up, that he were left no any power or prerogative at all, without his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects leave, or be ſo let looſe to his owne will and pleaſure, that he might injure, and oppreſſe his people as he liſt: that is to ſay, to have the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to enjoy ſuch a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects might not be over-bold, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his preſence without an awfull reverence, or he to be puffed up with a vaine opinion (by reaſon of his dignity) that the Kingdome or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was beſtowed upon his condition, more for his own uſe then the good of his people, nor I neither ſaid the Prieſt: whereupon being called away to ſupper they ſuddenly broake off the reſt of their diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The next day about noone they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called a campe, ſince the Souldiers ſeemed to beare all the ſway, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding others had a civill liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occaſion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full into the Kings preſence.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Euarchus</hi> was enformed not onely of their arrivall, but that <hi>Creſes</hi> had brought him letters out of <hi>Syria</hi> from the Queen, he with a great deale of paſſion ſent preſently for them into his preſence: upon their enterance they found him ſeated in a kind of a confined Majeſty, <hi>Farezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being on his right hand not farre from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a little below him ſtood one <hi>Hercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> his Lieutenant Generall, a man that ſeemed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169951:110"/>to carry not only deſigne, but policy in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: about them, were placed many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers in the nature of a gard; however expreſſing more then ordinary freedome both in their lookes and demeanor: <hi>Creſes</hi> after he had performed his wonted reverencies, approached the King with a humility anſwerable to his Titles, though not his condition; preſenting him with the Queens letters, which <hi>Euarchus</hi> haſtily taking out of his hands read them with teares in his eyes, and then asked him ſundry queſtions both of his wife and ſon Prince <hi>Arethuſius;</hi> wiſhing withall he might once more have the happineſſe to enjoy their company in <hi>Lydia:</hi> whereunto <hi>Creſes</hi> ſoon replyed, that he did not doubt but that the gods ere long, would to that purpoſe be favourable to his pious intentions: Truly ſaid the King turning at the ſame time to <hi>Farezius,</hi> this brave comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doth give me more then probable hopes to this effect: but <hi>Farezius</hi> made him no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, then by a kinde of humble bending of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſeemed to intimate a willingneſſe in any thing to comply with his deſires.</p>
            <p>Having for ſome time thus diſcourſed together in publick, the King (alſo taking notice of the old Prieſt with more then ordinary affection) he led <hi>Creſes</hi> into an out window in the ſame roome, that was ſheltred from the view of the common people, by large Curtaines that reached to the ground, where after they had continued for the ſpace of an houre in private conference, the King calling unto him <hi>Farezius</hi> uſed this language, with ſuch a look, as might procure compaſſion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169951:111"/>from the cruelleſt Tyrant in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farezius</hi> ſaid he, as I have ſufficient experience of your civilities, ſince it was my good fortune to be abſolutely under your juriſdiction, ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I but preſume upon the continuance of theſe curteſies, finding your nature to be both noble and conſtant: wherefore to this purpoſe I would have you know, that it is not alone my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire at this preſent, to have ſome comfort and conſolation by the ſight and converſation of my children, kept ſo long from my poſſeſſion by the power of the Senate ſitting at <hi>Sardis,</hi> but alſo have received conjurations by theſe Letters from my wife remaining in <hi>Syria,</hi> if it be poſſible ſo farre to procure my own information concerning their particulars, that I may give her a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of their comportment and education, whereby the better to ſatisfie her motherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and naturall inclination: when the King had ended this ſupplication, ſo farre (as I may ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his dignity, though conſonant in ſome ſort to his condition, <hi>Farezius</hi> after a ſhort pauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him this anſwer.</p>
            <p>Although I muſt confeſſe your Majeſties deſires, are grounded upon all the principles both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and morallity, yet you muſt be pleaſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to know, that at preſent I finde my owne power and intereſt ſo farre weakned in <hi>Sardis,</hi> by the prevailing faction of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> that I dare not be over conſident of any requeſt I ſhall make in your behalfe; eſpecially for that I am neither aſſured to continue ſtill the Senates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or can procure thoſe Senators to be puniſhed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169951:111"/>that with ſo much violence, exclaime howerly at that attempt of ours concerning your releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but nevertheleſſe if you pleaſe that <hi>Creſes</hi> now in communication with you, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a meſſenger to demand theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall procure him as large a commiſſon as poſſibly I can from the whole Army to that effect, and being denyed by the Senate any of our juſt deſires, we may adde your authority to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of the Souldiers to force them from the oppoſers: as theſe motions were quickly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Kings apprehenſion and conſent with many thankfull expreſſions, ſo <hi>Creſes</hi> wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage nor loyalty to take upon him the execution to the beſt advantage both for <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſervice and the armies profit.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Creſes</hi> arrived at <hi>Sardis,</hi> and had with ſome eloquence and more judgement delivered his meſſage, being againe retired for about halfe an houres ſpace, he received theſe anſwers to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular from the Senate: firſt it was told him that whereas it was deſired, the Kings chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might not only performe their naturall duty to their father by a ſpeedy viſit, but might alſo for ſome conſiderable time remaine in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſation (however they conceived it againſt the rules of State policy to have any ſingle perſon pleaſured before the publike good) yet that <hi>Farezius</hi> ſhould ſee how much they valued his requeſt, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey to that effect, upon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given for their ſafe returne after ſome few dayes of ſaluation: againe whereas the Generall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169951:112"/>ſeemed to deſire a continuation of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not only granted him his owne demand, but wiſht <hi>Creſes</hi> to aſſure <hi>Farezius,</hi> that as they had never any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own conſent, ſo would they ever be moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his brave and gallant ſervices: but for the propoſition that concerned the accuſation of ſome of their fellow Senators, they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the Commonwealth, to have them ſo much as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, much leſſe to ſuffer them brought as guilty Malefactors before another Tribunall then their own, being perſons (as they ſaid) whom they had found moſt true and faithfull to the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: Nevertheleſſe they condeſcendedby way of perſwaſion, to cauſe them voluntarily to leave the Kingdome for ſome ſmall time, whereby the better to allay the rage and diſcontents of the Souldiers, untill they could be fully ſatisfied in their endeavours and fidelities; theſe anſwers did but in part give content to <hi>Creſes</hi> expectation; eſpecially for that the Senate ſeemed, not only as he conceived, to put on a kinde of more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſolency in their demeanors, but withall did not ſo much as take any notice at all of <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> dignity, or that they intended any of thoſe reſpects for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Creſes</hi> with a great deale of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had attended their deliberations, yet he was content with ſome humility, to beg leave to viſit the Princeſſe, which being obtained, he found her ſeated in a melancholly roome, that had no
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169951:112"/>more light beſtowed upon it, then what was meerely neceſſary, for the performance of thoſe ſervices due to her condition, her perſon being ſhut up in a black Couch, ſo obſcured with divers Curtaines, that ſcarce could her rare beauty be otherwiſe diſcovered, then as the faire Moone, ſhaddowed by too many blacke clowds; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, now and then as the Princeſſe moved, there appeared bright and gentile rayes of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which could not be altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kiſſe her white hand, with many ſighes, and not a few teares, ſhe asked of her fathers health, with ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but the uncompaſſionate guard would not ſuffer her to be ſo punctuall in her queſtions as ſhe deſired, untill at laſt <hi>Creſes</hi> was ſeparated againe from her preſence by thoſe watchfull ſpyes, that had the neereſt cuſtody of her perſon, who belike as guilty men, feared Treaſon in their very lookes, ſince no words were uttered but what they underſtood; ſo that he was conducted to the Caſtle gate onely by <hi>Roxana's</hi> ample complements, inſtead of her Miſtreſſes more full expreſſions.</p>
            <p>But however the Senate had made theſe large promiſes during <hi>Creſes</hi> his preſence; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon other conſiderations, they not onely denyed the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> acceſſe to her father, being unwilling belike to hazzard ſo pretious a Jewell out of their cuſtody, but thoſe Senators accuſed of Treaſon, with the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, within a very few dayes beſet the Senate houſe with multitudes of their faction, not onely
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169951:113"/>denying to ſtand to the former Orders of giving <hi>Farezius</hi> poſſeſſion of the Caſtle of the Town; but alſo profeſſing, not to conſent to their own ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, alledging that the Generall rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be puniſhed as a Traitor; for having made ſo unjuſt and inſolent a demand, then themſelves to be judged for any crime, and were not onely liberall in their language, but cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Senate</hi> to diſannul their former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>
            <p>The news of this inraged multitude was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought unto the knowledge of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſo conſequently to <hi>Farezins,</hi> who after he had for ſome houres conſulted with the reſt of the Officers, reſolved to march towards the Walls of <hi>Sardis;</hi> where after a ſhort ſiege, and no great ſlaughter, the proud Inhabitants yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely to his mercy, whilſt the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the City, iſſued out to give him friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment, finding he had the greater par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Town. In this manner, with a moſt magnificent Triumph, they brought him to take poſſeſſion of that command, that before with ſome obſtinacy they had refuſed, and afterward moſt ceremoniouſly conducted him to the very <hi>Senate,</hi> in which place he was received with new honours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cloria</hi> having notice given her of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls intention, to viſit her, began to conſider with what reception ſhe ſhould entertain his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſince he appeared to her thoughts not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, who had lately conquered the whole Kingdom by his proſperity; but ſeemed at the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169951:113"/>preſent to graſpe the very fate of her Father, and therefore believed ſhe was not to receive him in her accuſtomed ſad poſture, leaſt he might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it either a contempt of his power, or a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his fortune; ſo that ſhe commanded her Chamber to be adorned with Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrope, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with compartments of gold, wherein was wrought the ſeverall armories of her anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of both ſides, divided by certain colours of rich cloth of <hi>Tiſſue,</hi> interwoven with ſuch variety of beautifull flowers, that it ſeemed the Princeſs had placed her ſelf in a delicious Garden, to give <hi>Farezius</hi> the more delightfull welcome; which was increaſed by her own ſweet counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſeated upon a bed of the ſame Livery: though the infide differed in invention, however it exceeded in curioſity, wherein with artificiall needlework, was deſigned the ſtory of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi> with that lively art, that the bluſhing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appeared in the boyes cheeks, at the laſcivious carriage of the Queen of Love, whilſt in other places he ſeemed to have put on a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that he had broke from her forcible imbracements: but that which was admirably expreſſed in death it ſelf, accompanied with a lively ſorrow, was the amazed grief of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, when ſhe beheld her ſlaughtered Servant, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the ſalvage Boor, and his dejected followers, ſeemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little leſs pittifull, to behold his poor Doggs here and there diſperſed, as if alſo they apprehended
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169951:114"/>their own loſſe, by their Maſters deſtruction. Over the Chimney was a large Picture of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workmanſhip, wherein was ſet forth the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of proud <hi>Tarquin,</hi> by his enraged Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Farezius</hi> entred the room, he pawſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while (being ſurprized with an intire amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) before he approached the Princeſs, as if he apprehended ſome fear of ſacriledge in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an appearing deity; but being invited by a gentle ſmile, that afforded not onely a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er encouragement to him, but added new grace, to her own beauty, he advanced with ſlow ſteps to perform thoſe reverences due to her dignity, which at laſt brought him to that diſtance, that gave her conveniency to aske him concerning her Fathers State; in which demand ſhe put on ſuch a look, that ſhewed ſhe deſired ſomething (though in words ſhe begged nothing) that eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay within his power to grant. But the Gods ſeemed too cruel to make her a mendicant, whoſe perfections deſerved rather to have ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command all hearts: However, the Generall, as if at the preſent he underſtood little elſe but admiration, for a long time anſwered not her queſtions, which gave occaſion to <hi>Cloria</hi> again to redouble her paſſion, with other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations upon the ſame ſubject; ſo that <hi>Farezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> at laſt breaking through his amazement, told her that he was in as proſperous a condition, as the unfortunate affaires of the Common-weale would permit, wherein he had imployed his beſt ſervice with all loyalty.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169951:114"/>
            <p>This anſwer ſcarce gave ſatisfaction to the Princeſs, ſince ſhe conceived <hi>Farezius</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his whole endeavours for the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the King in his ancient dignity; and therefore turn'd away from his ſight with a few gentle teares in her fair eyes; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Generall, he humbly beſought her to put off all ſadneſs from her heart, for that he did not doubt, but proſperity would ſucceed to her Father, according to his merit, and her own wiſhes; however the iſſue as he ſaid, muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended yet with ſome patience, ſince firſt the Souldiers were to be paid, who had ſpilt their blood freely for the liberty of their Country; and the common people in like manner muſt be ſatisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchaſe. But what the ſweet <hi>Cloria</hi> would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this diſcourſe could not be known, ſince <hi>Farezius</hi> occaſions call'd him ſuddenly away from her preſence into the City, not ſo much to receive thoſe Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure money for his Army.</p>
            <p>Though the Generall continued ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the rich Town of <hi>Sardis</hi> in impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning their chief Officers, as alſo in cauſing thoſe <hi>Senators</hi> which he had formerly accuſed to be ſent into baniſhment, yet the affaires of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> became no whit more amended, ſince he was not onely ſtill detained as a Priſoner, though with ſomething a greater liberty and freedom, but the <hi>Senate</hi> was permitted to preſs his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with thoſe former propoſitions they had
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169951:115"/>ſent by <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gyllius</hi> prejuditiall to his Crown, and in truth to the abſolute taking away of all his royall authority; which gave occaſion of many diſcourſes amongſt all ſorts of people: ſome ſaid that <hi>Farezius</hi> was in love with the Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> and by that means endeavoured to force the Kings conſent to the mariage, whom he thought elſe could not be brought to yield to ſuch unequall Nuptialls, much leſs would his Daughter be won to give up her perſon to thoſe diſadvantages, who had been courted by all the great Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with multitudes of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction began to prevail, and had by ſome means either bribed <hi>Farezius</hi> to their party, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted his deſigns. Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined, the people grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their own ſufferings, by reaſon of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies free quarter, ſuſpecting the Generalls power &amp; intentions only to make himſelf &amp; his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mighty, without looking upon their liberties and proſperity. For a teſtimony of which as they ſuppoſed, the Nobility carried the chief ſway in the <hi>Senate Houſe,</hi> contrary to their deſires; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, certain <hi>Trybunes</hi> were choſen in the Army, to preferr the rights of the ordinary Souldiers and common people.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe thoughts, or rather fancies were toſt to and fro, almoſt in every mans boſom; for that the whole affairs of the Kingdom were at a ſtand, and <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſeemingly no nearer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement then the firſt day he was impriſoned; nay farther off in moſt opinions: <hi>Roxand</hi> one
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169951:115"/>morning, according to her cuſtom (being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with more feares than ordinary; for that the Princeſs her Miſtriſs, appeared to her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not a little concerned in the buſineſs, ſince it was not improbable, ſome ſparkles of love joyned with <hi>Farezius</hi> ambition, might be obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt the Kings proſperity) came to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſelf, within certain groves belonging to the Caſtle, which were ordered into many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull walks, that here and there croſſed one another, for the more conveniency of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that ſhould frequent them for recreation; where long ſhe had not remained, diſputing with her doubts and hopes, but ſhe met accidentally with <hi>Creſes,</hi> who ſeemed to be there with the ſame intention; they both appeared pleaſed at the incounter, whereupon <hi>Creſes</hi> quickly asked her after ſome ſhort ſalutation, what ſhe thought of the ſtrangeneſs of theſe times, ſo much chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to both their expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally received in <hi>Sardis,</hi> then to have been ſtill continued a priſoner, much leſs to be preſſed with new propoſitions, diſhonourable to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and deſtructive to his authority. Truly my Lord, anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> as my thoughts are in a Wood about the actions of the times; ſo no doubt but ſom myſtery waits upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iſſue, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I muſt confeſs my fears outgoe my faith, in any good they mean the Kings power, ſince both the delayes uſed, and much more theſe Articles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, are no good Omens to <hi>Euarchus</hi> proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but take off rather that glory which <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:169951:116"/>ſhould have obtained to himſelf, if he had made the Kings reſtoration to his rights, his firſt and chiefeſt work, ſince by his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the reſt of the neceſſary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all probability have been better and ſurer ſetled, when they ſhould have carried with them both Law and Juſtice. You are in the right Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will diſcourſe to you ſome things which I have not only heard from the Kings own mouth, when I laſt waited upon him; but other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I took when I was in <hi>Syria,</hi> by which you may make what conjectures you pleaſe. So taking the old woman by the hand, he led her to a little banquetting houſe, not far off for the more privacy; where, after they were both ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he made unto her this Relation.</p>
            <p>Madam ſaid he, firſt you muſt underſtand, that <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King is oppoſed in his juſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather legall authority, by four facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that for the preſent ſeek to undermine one another, all having abſolutely in their hearts, caſt off their obedience to the Kings Perſon and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. The <hi>Senate</hi> ſtrives with violence to maintain that jurisdiction, it hath extorted from him; as the <hi>Myſians</hi> endeavour out of a high covetouſneſs, to be ſharers in the Government and Riches of this flouriſhing Kingdom. Neither wants the Army pretentions, by reaſon of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they have done in the late Warres, to claim reward and ſubſiſtance. And laſt of all, the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> in regard it hath for the moſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169951:116"/>part furniſhed the Souldiers and Councell with money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to ſay, to depend upon no ſubjection, but what Magiſtrates created by themſelves ſhall preſcribe. This contention of all ſides, is the chief occaſion as 'tis thought, that makes every thing at a ſtand, whilſt in the mean time, the people ſeem to cry out, being overburthened with oppreſſions and payments, which in the end certainly cannot but turn to an abſolute confuſion, ſince there is ſcarce poſſibility left to ſatisfie all parties: And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the common ſtate of things.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the proceedings of <hi>Syria,</hi> which I have moſt from the Kings own mouth, be pleaſed to underſtand, that when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aſſemble this great Councel, that hath proved ſo unfortunate to his happineſs, there was ſent into <hi>Lydia</hi> from <hi>Philoſtros</hi> an <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> as <hi>Euarchus</hi> imagined for his conſolation and aſſiſtance, againſt the violent proceedings of his <hi>Senate;</hi> but preſently after his arrivall, he was ſo far from complying with the Kings occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he kept a frequent correſpondence, with thoſe perſons that ſeemed moſt to oppoſe his authority; in ſo much, as the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained at laſt with ſome violence, not only to forbid him any longer attendance upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but earneſtly to deſire the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> to recall him home from all further imployment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> which ſetled the thoughts of <hi>Euarchus</hi> in ſome quietneſs, whilſt his own victories over his diſobedient ſubjects, and the death both of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169951:117"/>
               <hi>Philoſtros</hi> and <hi>Orsſames,</hi> gave the King more then probable hopes of a finall and happy ſucceſſe in his enterprize, which was againe in a very ſhort time, to reduce all <hi>Lydia</hi> under his lawfull juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: but belike the State of <hi>Syria</hi> following the ſame maximes of government, under the young ſon <hi>Orſames</hi> had left behind him, contrary to all humane expectation, ſent preſently after the death of <hi>Orſames</hi> another Ambaſſador to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> not only anew to invite him to breake the League which he ſtill continued with the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but to allow his conteſting Senate to be a lawfull and continued Councell by his abſolute approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thinking belike, that it would better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the affaires of <hi>Syria,</hi> to have <hi>Euarchus</hi> power limitted, then to ſuffer him to remaine in his high prerogative: but theſe demands the King moſt violently and diſdainfully refuſing, the Ambaſſador not only with ſome ſeeming diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent took his leave, but as it was thought invited the <hi>Myſſians</hi> againe into <hi>Lydia,</hi> which hath been as you know the reaſon of <hi>Euarchus</hi> overthrow, ſince the Senates ſingle power, had never probably prevailed againſt his fortune and ſucceſſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the buſineſſe did not yet reſt; for after the King had notwithſtanding ſtrugled with infinite difficulties, to make good ſtill his declining cauſe (his ſon <hi>Arethuſius</hi> Forces alſo being deſtroyed in many ſet Battells, who after fled into <hi>Syria</hi> to the Queen his Mother) <hi>Euarchus</hi> was forced to put himſelfe under the protection of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet with ſo little benefit to his affaires, that in a ſhort time after he was delivered in perſon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169951:117"/>into his enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardneſſe, untill the Army took him violently from that juriſdiction: As this Madam, is the ſad particulars I can relate unto you, of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, ſo may you very well make conjecture of the conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana</hi> after ſhe had thanked him for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein as ſhe ſaid, he had made her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome paſſages, ſhe never underſtood before, yet he ſhould oblige her much more if he would be pleaſed to deliver his opinion, what might be the intentions of the <hi>Syrian</hi> State, in thus deſiring to leſſen, or rather to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence to overthrow the Monarchy of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſince the example ſeemed of a dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for its own government, for that thoſe Subjects might alſo fall upon the like pretences.</p>
            <p>Truly anſwered <hi>Creſes,</hi> what I can ſay of that Theame is, that either they thinke it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the glory of <hi>Syria,</hi> to reduce all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes but their owne, into Commonwealths, whereby theirs may appeare to <hi>Aſia</hi> the onely Empire: or they have an intention to make a conqueſt of ours, by reaſon of thoſe multitudes of diviſions, they ſee ariſing amongſt our ſelves; or perhaps they ayme to ſet up Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> in his fathers Kingdome, becauſe he is of the <hi>Syrian</hi> bloud, whereby they believe they ſhall purchaſe both honour and friendſhip.</p>
            <p>But if I thought I ſhould not prove over harſh in my unpolliſht language, whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would diſcover yet a ſtory, though acted long
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169951:118"/>time ſince, that in my opinion, hath been the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the ſad effects of this laſt Warre: it will prove the longer, in regard it toucheth the proceedings, not only of the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but the Countries of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Myſſia,</hi> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have been all three interwoven in dangers, ſlaughters and civill broyles, by the ſpightfull proceedings, and factious maximes, of a certaine Prieſt called <hi>Herenzius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana</hi> glad to entertaine any conveniency, that might inſtruct her farther, in the Myſteries of theſe unlucky times, although many things ſhe had read of <hi>Herenzius</hi> violent ſpirit, told <hi>Creſes,</hi> that as no language proceeding from his lips, could prove tedious to any eare how ignorant ſoever; ſo did ſhe not doubt, but the conſequence of the preſent affaires, required rather ample ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then ſhort deſcriptions, which gave him a ſufficient warrant to uſe his own pleaſure, both for the manner and matter of his diſcourſe, untill his endeavours produced this following relation.</p>
            <p>You muſt know ſaid he, that this Prieſt <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> ſome yeares ſince, when all the world ſeemed to yeild obedience to the great <hi>Flamine</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> as the only Oracle upon earth to preſcribe the manner of the worſhip of the gods, ſuddenly ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> who by reaſon of an ignominious puniſhment he had undergone (as twas reported for a hainous offence committed againſt humane and divine Lawes) began violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall out with heaven and earth; in ſo much as in the firſt place, he quarrelled with the forme of the ſervice to the Gods then uſed; and in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169951:118"/>latter, he denyed Kings and Princes obedience, or rather loyalty from their naturall ſubjects; To this purpoſe to execute his malice againſt all authority, becauſe he had ſuffered by it; and withall thinking againe in ſome ſort to recover his loſt reputation, in doing notable actions, how wicked ſoever, of a ſudden flew to a certaine Towne upon the confines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had newly, not only diſobeyed their <hi>Flamine</hi> but caſt off their government to his authority, which quickly gave him admittance, with his Doctrine, ſince they knew his opinions ſuited with their deſignes; yet being rather friendly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then perfectly eſtabliſhed by their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, his inſolency and pride in a ſhort time, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him againe from the City, ſeeing he could not ſhew temper in his firſt entrance; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained untill the feare of the inhabitants, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming once more under their old government, for that they underſtood their Prince prepared for a ſiege, conſtrained them, not onely a new to deſire his company, whereby to be aſſiſted by his Councell, but were forced to binde themſelves by a ſolemne oath, to ſubmit abſolutely their wills to his inſtitutions: with theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he became fully poſſeſſed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to governe as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and inſtruct as he liſted, untill he had fitted all their thoughts, for the impreſſions of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes by the eloquent language, and cunning practices he uſed, which in a ſhort time ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that many diſciples were found of ſuch towardly diſpoſitions, inſtructed by his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169951:119"/>that he ſent many of them alſo into other Countries, to poyſon the peoples loyalties, ſince obedience is the moſt aſſured tye, that probably warrants the ſafety and proſperity of Kingdomes. But theſe men having as I ſaid, taken their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes with theſe intentions, the firſt prevailing progreſſe they made, was in the Countrey of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> where finding ſome diſcontents already ingendring between the young Queen then raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grandmother to <hi>Euarchus:</hi> and ſome factious and ambitious Nobility, ſoon introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common people, by which meanes the Lords became alſo ſo powerfull by their aſſiſtance, that the poore Princeſſe in a ſhort ſpace, was forced to quit both her Kingdome and Life, a Tragedy too pittifull now to be related, whilſt the Rebells took poſſeſſion of her authority, from which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation proceedes <hi>Lydia's</hi> miſeries, ſince by a continuance of the ſame deſires in thoſe people towards her poſterity, they have now filled this Kingdome with tumults, troubles, and bloud, the better to make good their own juriſdictions ſo unlawfully purchaſed in former times: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe opinions of depoſing of Kings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the worſhip of the gods, prevailed entirely in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe crafty and factious actors that <hi>Herezius</hi> had ſent; yet his Doctrine found not ſo ready acceptance in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for that the Queen then raigning, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured againſt the violence of all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, both to conſerve Monarchy, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their <hi>Flamines,</hi> though the State altered
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169951:119"/>many Tenents in Doctrine, untill the late agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of each Nation to oppoſe <hi>Euarchus</hi> in the ſame deſigne, contrived an accord to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in effect both King and <hi>Flamines:</hi> This may paſſe my diſcourſe of the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> that hath not only formerly borne part in the ſuffering, by reaſon of theſe opinions ſowed in the world, but hath been a principall occaſion to give the <hi>Myſſians</hi> protection, by whoſe power <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath been chiefely deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe you muſt underſtand, that although <hi>Herezius</hi> other meſſengers, could not ſo eaſily beate downe the ſtrong Walles of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, eſtabliſhed by ſo many ages in <hi>Syria,</hi> againſt the power of great Armies alwayes kept in pay by that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdome with moſt lamentable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to gaine enterance for their opinions, and freedome for their Doctrine; in ſo much as the Prince himſelfe then governing, finding the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples overthrowne, his Countrey ſpoyled, and his Subjects deſtroyed by the fury of the contention, was forced at laſt, ſo farre to give way to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezians</hi> religion in <hi>Syria,</hi> that they had not only granted them, a free exerciſe of their conſciences throughout all his dominions, but many fortified Townes were delivered into their hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they put their owne Garriſons, to ſecure better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and ſeemed to give them ſatisfaction for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: however, every yeare almoſt after notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe benefits, produced new ſtirres by that faction, to the diſquieting of the Kingdome,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169951:120"/>that gave ſufficient cauſe of vexation to many good Princes, ſince they could not be aſſured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects, nor of the continuation of their owne proſperities, when neither graces could win them by reaſon of the ſpleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compell them in regard of thoſe Forts they had in their cuſtody.</p>
            <p>But to be ſhort, before the great and wiſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> durſt take upon him the huge worke he intended, which was to ſuppreſſe the gloriouſneſſe of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Empire, he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he could not be abſolutely ſafe at home, and ſo conſequently not fitted for ſo large a conqueſt, as long as he ſhould leave behind him in his own boſome, ſo eminent a danger as thoſe he eſteemed lawleſſe Subjects in <hi>Orſames</hi> Kingdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would upon all occaſions, be ready to joyne with forraigne Forces, to overthrow their owne Kings government, and therefore reſolved firſt, before he undertooke any new deſigne, to ſubdue their power, to the abſolute obedience of his great Maſters juriſdiction, as in times paſt it had been to ſome of his predeceſſors; to which purpoſe he not only ſuddenly beſieged the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Towne they had in <hi>Syria,</hi> but within a ſhort ſpace, left them never a Fort in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that was not conſtrained to deliver up the Keyes of its Gates, to the will and pleaſure of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Orſames,</hi> who began to grow great in the opinion of the world, by the conqueſt of his own Subjects, that were accuſtomed to give ſufficient imployment to other Kings.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:169951:120"/>
            <p>However, after that <hi>Philoſtros</hi> had made this ſpeedy progreſſe in glory, as well as in ſecurity for his Maſters; parant advantage, both in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Subjects at home, and terrifying his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, which proved mighty advantages for thoſe deſignes he had contrived in his politick braine, becauſe it was not convenient, and ſcarce ſafe to continue deſperate diſcontents in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a body, that had vaſtly ſpread it ſelfe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough moſt Countries in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whilſt his thoughts and endeavours were otherwiſe to be imployed; he began by little and little, to ſmooth his brow towards that ſect, and at laſt not only aſſured them of his abſolute forgetting all faults paſt, but made many of them chiefe officers and commanders in that Army <hi>Orſames</hi> provided, to goe againſt the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Forces, wherein he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily procured a double commodity to his affaires, the one in winning a party he had good cauſe to ſuſpect, and the other in rendring them ingaged in the quarrell, he intended againſt <hi>Soraſtros;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he was moſt aſſured, that they would fight with ſpleen againſt that religion by nature they moſt hated, ſince the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of all others were held obſequious to the rights and ceremonies of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which alſo was a meanes to binde the <hi>Myſſians</hi> to the affaires of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſince no Nation or people in <hi>Aſia,</hi> profeſſed more violently the ſame worſhip of the gods introduced by <hi>Horen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi> and exerciſed by his followers in <hi>Orſames</hi> dominions, which were not onely reaſons to tye <hi>Philoſtros</hi> to that ſect, by all the favours he could procure it in his own Country, whereby to make
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169951:121"/>them ſerviceable in the Warres, he had with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtros,</hi> but by that meanes gave countenance to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> againſt <hi>Euarchus:</hi> their lawfull Prince; which by conſequence afforded the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> conveniency alſo to ſuppreſſe his power, that they might not ſeeme to goe leſſe in juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in maſtering their King, then thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they had bought with their money, onely to doe them ſervice, ſo that by this meanes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite gave worke enough at home to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> that he ſhould not have the opportunity, although he might have the wil to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which the pollicy of every Nation requires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome opinions, when a Prince is not able to make good his party againſt another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Monarch.</p>
            <p>This Madam as I ſay, hath been the fate of theſe mighty Kingdomes, only troubled by the cunning induſtry of one factious and ambitious Prieſt, as if the Gods had ſent him into the world to let man ſee his owne frailty; and the rather for that <hi>Euarchus</hi> not many yeares agoe, appeared ſo glorious and fortunate in his government, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a flouriſhing proſperity, in wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, peace, and power, that he was not only the abſolute envy of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but ſeemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now caſt downe into ſo low, and I may call it miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, by a little faction of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he is not only denyed to be a King, but deprived of the comfort of all that ever was his, with an addition of a ſharpe and laſting captivity, according to the diſcretion ſometimes of his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169951:121"/>meaneſt Subjects; whilſt in the interim, honour, love, juſtice, and gratitude ſeeme to be laid a ſleep in the deep Center of the earth, other Princes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching to their own prepoſterous ſpleen, not conſidering how ſoon it may be their fortunes, to fall under the ſame Fate, for that all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covet liberty; with theſe words he reſted ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with his armes acroſſe, as if yet his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, went higher then his tongue was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. This diſcourſe gave the old woman alſo ſome leaſure to ſhed a few teares, in confidering the Kings misfortunes,</p>
            <p>But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the ſudden arrivall of the little dwarfe, who told <hi>Roxana,</hi> that he had been a long time ſearching her all over the Parke, to informe her, that the Princeſſe was newly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the garden to take ſome recreation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, and deſired earneſtly her company, to impart ſomething of conſequence to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; This gave <hi>Roxana</hi> no more opportunity, then civilly to thanke <hi>Creſes</hi> for thoſe informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had given her, profeſſing againe ſhe was inſtructed in many things ſhe had never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that might afford light as ſhe ſaid, to her comportment and converſation, ſince ſhe was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpute with ſome enemy or other in <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> quarrell; and withall deſired him he would be pleaſed, to put on a reſolution often to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her in that place, not only for her better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but for her Miſtreſſes conſolation, which you may be ſure was a tickling motive to invite <hi>Creſes</hi> to the ſervice, being perſwaded, the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169951:122"/>Princeſſe ſhould partake of his diſcourſe; and love ſpeakes the moſt effectuall language, though it want never ſo much probability to enjoy,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana</hi> when ſhe came into the Garden, ſhee found the Princeſſe retired into a cloſe walk, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Sunnes oppreſſion, which alſo obſcured her in ſome ſort from the fight of her attendants; ſo that the old woman had occaſion given her by that retirement, to believe new accidents had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſolitude: Wherefore approaching at a neerer diſtance, ſhe might perceive a paper in <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> hand, whilſt ſhe ſtood ſtill lifting up her faire eyes to the heavens, then againe caſt them downe upon the ground, and in this poſture ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced two or three ſteps, with a kinde of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion; this continued <hi>Roxana</hi> the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before ſhe diſcovered her being there, untill the Princeſſe turning that way, ſhe was neceſſarily invited to preſent her ſelfe; however ſhe had not come neere her by a few paces, but <hi>Cloria</hi> with a deepe ſigh, inſtead of other expreſſions, caſt her the paper ſhe held, which the old woman preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading, found it ſpake this matter:</p>

               <hi>Roxana</hi> after ſhe had read the Letter, ſtood ſtill ſometime in a Muſe, untill at laſt paſſionately ſhe broake out into theſe words: Truly Madam ſaid ſhe, as I cannot but ſmile at the former part of the writing, ſo muſt I needs wonder at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince it ſeemeth as prepoſterous, Prince <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſhould after a long ſilence, attempt your love, when hee remained quiet during the Generals ſuppoſed greatneſſe, as it appeares ſtranger to my thoughts, the King hath now removed his Quarters, when he was ſuppoſed ſecure in <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius</hi> protection. But alaſſe ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I rather marvell whither my Father can poſſibly be fled to purchaſe more hopes, for that all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is probably out of his juriſdiction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould be glad to flatter my ſelfe with ſome opinions, that the deſigne was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot promiſe that anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Roxana,</hi> yet certainly the King being ſo wiſe, would never have ventured upon ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempt, without long conſideration and aſſured friends to conduct him to his journeyes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169951:123"/>end; but if I may rove according to my wilde imagination, either he is gone into <hi>Syria,</hi> ſince I cannot believe he would any more truſt his perſon with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> who have divers times deceived him: or is invited into <hi>Creet</hi> by his Subjects there in Armes againſt the Senate, the better to make good their cauſe againſt the new <hi>Lydian</hi> Forces, preparing to bring them ſpeedily under ſubjection. The gods will be done ſaid the poore Princeſſe, but I feare the worſt; Theſe diſcourſes brought them to the reſt of the company in the Garden, to make them alſo ſharers of the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected newes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana</hi> the next morning had ſcarce leaſure given her to welcome the day, when ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by a meſſenger ſent from <hi>Creſes,</hi> that within two houres ſpace, he would attend her if ſhe pleaſed, at the banquetting houſe amongſt the Woods, not only to finiſh out the reſt of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but alſo to let her know other paſſages worth her acceptance. The old Matron concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it was ſome intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, ſent him thanks, and promiſed with all diligence to wait upon the ſummons, which ſhe performed a pretty while before <hi>Creſes</hi> arrivall, that gave her opportunity to examine her own imagination; but it was not long before ſhe was interrupted by his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which with a few ceremonies ſeated them both together as the day before, whilſt <hi>Creſes</hi> uſed this language.</p>
            <p>Though I may ſuppoſe (ſaid he) you have heard ſomething of the Kings departure from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169951:123"/>under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been enformed of the reaſons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call it an eſcape, ſince he was perſwaded it would be for his better ſafty: <hi>Roxana</hi> confeſſing, ſhe knew nothing of the manner much leſſe the cauſe, though common fame had brought the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to her eares; <hi>Creſes</hi> gave her this farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the paſſage, according to the relation he had from an officer intruſted in the ſervice as he ſaid.</p>
            <p>The King ſaid he, being not only ſuſpitious of the ſecurity of his perſon, by reaſon of the many diviſions of opinion in the Campe; ſome deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Prince, others none; eſpecially conſidering the diverſity of humours amongſt the common Souldiers, who generally laboured for an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall equality, as alſo being credibly enformed that unleſſe he would preſently condeſcend to thoſe propoſitions formerly ſent unto him, with the addition of ſome priviledges demanded that were more deſtructive to his Crowne and dignity, he ſhould infallibly be murthered, he was conſtrained to this ſudden retirement: however I muſt tell you theſe rumours were given out as 'twas belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, only to fright him to ſeek another ſtation, where he might be againe impriſoned with ſome colour and better ſecurity, as pretending his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to eſcape out of the Armies juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power: ſo that the poore King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cauſes enough for a ſuſpition, acquainted two of his ſervants both with his feares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, who to be ſhort, perſwaded him to fly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169951:124"/>to an Iſland upon the borders of <hi>Caria,</hi> where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines as governour a valiant commander, though formerly imployed by the Senate, yet at the preſent was conceived to be wholly at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Farezius</hi> and the Army: this Captaine they aſſured him would be entirely faithfull to his deſignes, though upon what grounds I can neither informe you or ſatisfie my ſelfe, ſince the conſequence proved otherwiſe: for no ſooner was the King arrived under his juriſdiction, but he entertained him not only with a ſad and ſowre countenance, but after he had ſecured his perſon in the Caſtle, and ſent away his two officers, he preſently gave information to the Senate of all the proceedings, deſiring further directions in what manner he ſhould be treated; though he carries ſtill in his demeanour, a kinde of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his dignity: all theſe paſſages as I told you before, I have from one of thoſe perſons new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, that accompanied him in the journey, with this advertizement alſo that before the Kings departure from the Campe, he left in his chamber under his own hand, the reaſon of his feares and his eſcape: all which Madam I may ſay is in ſuch a miſt, that no leſſe a knowledge then ſome divine Oracle can informe us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the certainty of the myſtery: only we may be confident that <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath imployment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his courage and patience: At theſe words <hi>Roxana</hi> wept againe with the very ſence of the Kings dangers and miſeries: Nay ſaid <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> his ſuffering of all ſides are ſo extreame, that notwithſtanding he hath ſent to <hi>Farezius</hi> and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169951:124"/>offered to accord every difference and intereſt in the Kingdome, being heard; yet neither the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall nor Senate will entertaine the motion, or allow him that priviledge, fearing belike he ſhould ſpeak too much reaſon to render his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſatisfied, whereby they might be endangered to loſe that authority which now they poſſeſſe without contradiction. But ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> why doe the common people deſire violently no King, ſince <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſhewes ſuch teſtimonies of his goodneſſe? Truly ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> as that opinion in the Generall is erronious, ſince all be not of that faction, ſo of the other ſide, there be too many that wiſh an univerſall equality, not conſidering the confuſion it would bring upon the whole Kingdome, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for moſt of them by ſuch a parity, would be in more ſlavery then they are now, ſince they could never be capable of any command, and neceſſarily muſt obey thoſe that would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne with more rigour, though elected from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: beſides they are now ſo weary of the Senates rule in the ſame poſture, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſome experience of their managing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires hitherto, that they believe their owne cure can proceed from nothing but deſperate change, which is incident to all diſtempered minds; ſince they that could not be well under <hi>Euarchus</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and proſperity (though no doubt but there was ſome abuſes) certainly now will not reſt ſatisfied when they ſhall feele nothing but want, oppreſſion, and inſtability; beſides many
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169951:125"/>feare that things are not yet at the worſt, when ſo many contrary intereſts with violence ſeeme to contend. Theſe diſcourſes brought them both at laſt in diſpute, whether active valour, or paſſive courage were the greater vertue, in that <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſeemed to poſſeſſe them in a high kinde. But <hi>Creſes</hi> who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with theſe arguments: firſt ſaid he, before we can well conſider what hath been the Kings ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, we muſt rightly ſtate his misfortunes, which will appeare to be the greater, when it is well knowne to the world, he hath alwayes ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage in the Warres, by venturing boldly his perſon upon all occaſions, as alſo eloquence and judgement both by his Pen and language, when thoſe faculties of Art and Nature were thought neceſſary and uſefull; a plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that he wants not ſenſe and knowledge fully to apprehend his own oppreſſions: and the rather may it be ſo thought, for that thoſe who have moſt gaiued by his favours, the ungratefull <hi>Myſſians,</hi> with ſome others of his owne Court, have been the chiefe Inſtruments, or rather I may ſay the only cauſe that have deprived him not only of the priviledge of his royall Crowne, but of all the perſonall happineſſes he enjoyed in his proſperity; beſides his want of liberty now at laſt to make up the full <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of his miſery, none almoſt giving eare to his complaints, or pittying his captivity: though they have ſeparated him from his beloved Queene, in whoſe beauty and vertues he took an unſpeakable felicity, as alſo the comfort of beholding his ſweet children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169951:125"/>a reall part of himſelfe, which the gods and nature have ordained to man as a humane right; accompanied with the detention of his revenues that ſhould maintaine him and them: beſides proſecuting him with as many ſlanders as they can invent.</p>
            <p>This Madam as it may be ſuppoſed, being the true condition of <hi>Euarchus</hi> misfortune, it may eaſily be conjectured, his ſufferings are equall, if not goe beyond example, and yet his noble heart holds out ſtill to endure as you ſee, what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding offers love, mercy and patience to his whole Kingdome and worſt injurers: things being in this poſture I ſhall proceed to the making good of my promiſed argument; which is, that paſſive courage is a greater vertue then active valour; if my diſcourſes doe not ſeeme too tedious for your more neceſſary imployment.</p>
            <p>As I muſt call the Kings conſtancy a noble for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſince he hath neither Subject of hope, nor object of diverſion, ſo certainly is it the higheſt magnanimity for a Prince to ſuffer patiently and without confuſion from his own Subjects that owe him duty and gratitude; for thoſe men that hazzard their lives freely in deſperate ſervices, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ayme at victory or conqueſt, by which they intend to purchaſe gaine or glory, which enflames their blouds with continuall agitation, that ſcarce gives leaſure to reflect upon the dangers, much leſſe time for cold and apprehenſive conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet we ſee ſuch have for the moſt part need of noyſe of drums and ſound of Trumpets to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169951:126"/>waken their courages, or lay aſleep their feares, to continue them better in action, whereas ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath nothing to helpe or comfort it, ſince the minde is ſtill prepared to entertaine the miſery it ſuſtaineth, with a pale expectation of the ſame or worſe, when as I ſay it is known it muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured without hope, having no diverſion: like a perſon ſick in the night, wanting objects of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, thinks that ſeaſon longer and his torment greater by much then in the day time; for where the minde is kept high by ambition to compaſſe ſomething it coveteth, it hath power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling to its proper center the earth, where naturally it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines: but being without comfort, if a man doe not make ſtrong uſe of his noble part his ſoul, to maintaine his courage and reſolution, the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or captivating of fleſh and bloud, will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man quickly totally overcome, and that is the reaſon that long and tedious perſecutions have deſtroyed more competent ſpirits, then ſharp and violent tortures, ſince they were prepared for the one with expectation, and only weared by the other with continuance. We know that old men ſtrive more greedily to preſerve their lives that ſhort time they are to live, then young men in their moſt flouriſhing yeares; becauſe diverſity of proſpects operates ſo much in youthfull boſomes, by reaſon of continuall activity, tending that way, that they have not leaſure to ſettle their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon horrid apprehenſion; when old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſo much time to think (wanting power of action) that the object which is naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169951:126"/>often before their eyes to fright them, and ſo fares it with a perſon that only ſuffers, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him that doth both ſuffer and act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: wherefore that perſon hath need of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage, becauſe there is nothing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his thoughts of variety or diverſion; for certainly it pleaſeth a man rather to contend for his life, though he know he ſhall be deprived of it, then to loſe it without any ſtrife at all; which ſeemes to be the caſe of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> ſince they will not ſo much as permit him with reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver up his Crowne: and more grievous a great deale is his condition, in that he appeares to be left of all thoſe friends that have been moſt obliged to his goodneſſe. What is the reaſon that a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the Scaffold is accuſtomed to have his eyes banded before the ſtroake of death, to take away from him the apprehenſion of the blow which he knowes he ſhall receive? When a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier in the Field without ſhaddow will charge againſt a thouſand weapons, with as much certainty of deſtruction, but becauſe the ones acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on frees him from the others terrour: All which ſhew, that a ſad expectation of an ill, augments the ſuffering, when a diverſion by imployment of the body, or buſying the ſenſes by diverſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, take away that apprehenſion that makes any danger or miſery exceſſively horrid; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, men for the moſt part are put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or low whiſpers, to render the ſufferer more ſenſible of the paine, by the quieting of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169951:127"/>and ſo it fares with ſuch as paſſe through darke places, being afraid of every ſmall ruſtle, when in the day time, the ſame way perhaps is pleaſant; ſo that as I ſay without doubt, all ſmart, griefe, and diſcontent is encreaſed by want of action and too much leaſure for conſideration; for I muſt conclude, that it is a great deale eaſier for a perſon to dye fighting in the Field, though he ſhould be cut in ſunder in a thouſand pieces, then to endure a long and tedious captivity, which is <hi>Euarchus</hi> preſent condition; in ſo much as at laſt if he ſhould in ſome ſort yield to this cruelty, I muſt not finde fault with his courage, but if he gaine the victory, I ſhall eſteeme him a miracle of nature.</p>
            <p>As I muſt not ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> goe about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your arguments grounded upon ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and more delivered by the knowne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your excellent judgement, ſo of the other fide, I could wiſh the King had ſome Counſell to aſſiſt him in theſe difficulties beſides his own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and courage, ſince it is impoſſible but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature at the length will be tired with over much ſuffering, and by conſequence faile for want of true information: there is no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your opinion ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> but ſuch is the crafty ſpight of ſome, that they will permit none to be about the Kings perſon that dares loyally afford him any profitable conſolation, becauſe they may the ſooner bring him to conſent to their deſires: Yet replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> it is not well known what thoſe deſires are, ſince they never durſt for all I could ever learne, publickly declare their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169951:127"/>but doe as it were in a dark miſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſſe the people, that the King refuſeth ſomething he is obliged to grant for the good of his Subjects; by which meanes they ſtrive ſtill to maintaine their credits and opinions amongſt the common ſort. It is ſo Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince you are fallen upon that point, I ſhall let you know, how farre the King hath yet condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to their demands, whereby the better to diſpoſſeſſe the People of that beliefe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to have in the Senates integrity, though I verily thinke, they now more feare their power, then truſt their intentions; for whereas not many dayes agoe, they propoſed to <hi>Euarchus</hi> to have the power of the force of the Kingdome for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares both by Sea and Land, the King hath yielded to grant them that juriſdiction during his life, though not for that terme, which appears now to be the greateſt difference between them, ſince the Senate ſeemes not content with this offer: whereupon the <hi>Myſſians</hi> have lately put out a furious declaration againſt the Senate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the King to ſuch unreaſonable conditions: In good earneſt anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> I cannot tell, whether I have more cauſe to ſmile at the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ridiculouſneſſe of theſe proceedings, or be amazed to ſee men growne ſo fooliſhly unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſince <hi>Euarchus</hi> appeares to my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to be willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires; for that if he grant the power of the Kingdome out of his hands during his life, it gives more aſſurance to the Senate that he intends no more to raigne,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169951:128"/>if he had quitted his power for ſo many yeares only, ſince he might have ſome thought to over live that preſcribed terme; againe for the <hi>Myſſians</hi> I wonder moſt of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been as I may ſay, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe that hath made him no King, though now anew, they ſeeme to deſire to re-eſtabliſh him in his ancient authority, which certainly cannot be but upon other deſignes of advantage to themſelves, more then for <hi>Euarchus</hi> proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Truly Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> in the generall it is as you ſay, but yet there are ſo many myſteries hid under theſe proceedings, that they are capable to deceive the ſharpeſt judgement, if ſome light be not given by information: Wherefore you muſt know that both <hi>Euarchus</hi> and the Senate know very well, that the conſequence of all the Affaires, chiefly depend upon the aſſurance of the ſafety of the Kings perſon, ſince he can never hope to be againe re-eſtabliſhed in his rightfull authority, but either by the humours and inconſtancy of the common people, who when they finde the Kings absolute oppreſſion brings no proſperity to them, will probably become exaſperated againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates proceedings and power, or by an unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable difference betweene the Senators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who may moſt command when they ſhall finde no other juriſdiction to oppoſe them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if he ſit quiet ſometime under his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which I conceive to be the reaſon that he hath in outward appearance yielded ſo much to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169951:128"/>their demands. And for the <hi>Myſſians</hi> perhaps by this oppoſition they would perſwade the world to a beliefe of their integrities, as if at the firſt they conſented not to the Kings hard uſage, whereby to obtaine a greater party, not only in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> if they have an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſpute their own profit: but in other Countries if they meane to make Warre upon our people, becauſe they cannot be ſharers in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as they hoped, the only cauſe certainly of the now ſeeming quarrell; ſo that in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath done like a wiſe and politick Prince, in ſeeming not to contend, where he was ſure not to prevaile, eſpecially ſince by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, he might have endangered thoſe hearts that will now be of his ſide, if the occaſion be offered, either out of pitty to his ſufferings, or our of hate to the Senates government; And beſides, it is to be conſidered, that no act he ſhall paſſe in this condition of conſtraint, can binde either himſelfe or poſterity by all humane and divine lawes, if his Sword ever become more powerfull: in the meane time, the Senate will ſeek to preſerve the Kings life and perſon with their beſt care, ſince their own authority falls entirely by his death, which as I ſay is the reaſon they deſire more a terme of yeares in the continuation of thier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired government, then the determinable fate of the Princes life, becauſe they may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the liberty to preſſe him to new conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they finde by experience they have not yet obtained ſufficient, ſince they ſhall not need to feare the vexations of his perſon, may bring any hazard upon him.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:169951:129"/>
            <p>I cannot deny ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> but theſe reaſons are ſufficient to render me wholly ſatisfied in my doubtfull opinions, but the gods are only capable to foreſee the event of things. And with that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the Sun, ſhe perceived the time of the day called her to the attendance of the Princeſſe, which made her for the preſent take her leave. Upon her arrivall ſhe found <hi>Cloria</hi> only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her Lute in a ſmall withdrawing room belonging to her own chamber, where none but her ſelfe had permiſſion to be admitted: not long after ſhe had ſaluted the Princeſſe, ſhe diſcovered ſhe had been weeping, by the red circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occaſion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be inquiſitive after her imployment; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe ſpyed this complaining ditty lying written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her ſatisfaction of the occaſion, though her excellent voyce and rare skill rendred the Muſick heavenly.</p>

            <p>But the Princeſſe after ſhe had made an end of her Muſicke, began with many complaints and more ſighes to blame abſent <hi>Narciſſus</hi> for his too much negligence in his love, ſince in all this time of her laſt reſtraint he had not found as ſhe ſaid ſome diſguiſe to viſit her perſon, though he might want the power to procure her liberty; which ſhe continued with a certaine paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Roxana</hi> not only chid her for thoſe ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that as ſhe told her had deſtroyed in part the raviſhing delight of her ſong, but ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in accuſing her ſervant, that had in ſo many dangerous adventures ſhewed alwayes the entire conſtancy of his affection, who was no doubt at
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169951:130"/>the preſent retired into ſome region, where he might beſt advantage her ſervice. However <hi>Cloria</hi> was willing upon any hopes, to be ſatisfied with the proceedings of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and much more with his intentions; yet could ſhe not but tell <hi>Roxana,</hi> that although ſhe was pleaſed to be his advocate that ſeemed to have a powerfull perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in her beliefe, yet were the loves ſhe feared from <hi>Farezius,</hi> and the importunities ſhe expected of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> in her apprehenſion, arguments ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make her think <hi>Narciſſus</hi> wanted much diligence, at leaſtwiſe violence, that he did not endeavour to ſcale the very Walles where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a priſoner, rather then to endure her to be ſo injured. Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I cannot tell why you ſhould expect miracles inſtead of ſervices, ſo have you no cauſe to doubt the importunities you mention, ſince I am not certaine <hi>Farezius</hi> love was ever preſented to your liking: either from himſelfe, or any of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; And for the Addreſſes of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> you have been already ſo accuſtomed to refuſals, that I conceive you have not any other hard part to play then to continue the ſame courſe ſtill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you may well remember by <hi>Caſſianus</hi> own Letter, that his affections are not ſo hot, as to preſſe you upon over great inconveniences; and therefore, in my opinion you may very well quiet your thoughts concerning his courtſhips.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, you are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in both theſe particulars, for as to my knowledge (which I have underſtood ſince I ſaw you laſt) <hi>Farezius</hi> hath already intimated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169951:130"/>to my father, whom you may be ſure will comply almoſt in any thing that concernes the Generall, So doth <hi>Caſſianus</hi> labour the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love, ſince as he ſayes, their own honours are ingaged in the iſſue, for that the world takes notice of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, which are to ſee him eſtabliſhed in a proſperous condition both in power and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the rather as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Hold your ſelfe content woman ſaid the Princeſſe, there is no limitation of ſelfe-love and ambition, when they have once taken poſſeſſion of a proud heart, though covered with never ſo meane an extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And you know that <hi>Farezius</hi> is a gentleman, which joyned with his former ſucceſſe in the Warres, and his preſent command now in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot want perſwaſions to make him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any enterprize for his own glory, eſpecially ſince the King ſeemes meerly to depend upon his aſſiſtance, or allowance for his future proſperity; and being ſo, what counſell can you give me ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169951:131"/>to prevent his violence or inſtruct his paſſion, ſince I dare not be too bold, in hazarding my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fortunes by provoking the Generalls ſpleen by a harſh and diſdainefull deniall.</p>
            <p>In good ſooth ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I am very glad to ſee, you have learned ſome temper ſince you were in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> where as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I had much adoe to perſwade you to entertaine reaſon, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

No by all the immortall gods anſwered the ſweet Princeſſe, my affection is as pure and conſtant as it was in <hi>Oſiris</hi> Court, if not encreaſed by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of more tryalls to render it abſolutely judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, only the conſideration of my fathers preſent captivity, and future danger makes me ſo farre willing to diſpence with my own deare love, as to maske it over with ſome hypocriſie, for his ſake, which formerly I was unwilling to purchaſe with the aſſurance of my own life, when I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the City of <hi>Memphis;</hi> only the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a neceſſarily jealouſie in <hi>Narciſſus</hi> breaſt, when rumours ſhall bring ſuch reports to his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eares, I muſt confeſſe ſomething deterres my reſolution, from any diſſimulation at all in love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honour.</p>
            <p>Indeed Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I doe not now only, begin to love you for your wiſdome, but will endeavour to put a project into your head,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169951:131"/>that may both keep your father ſafe, and perhaps deſtroy your enemies, at leaſtwiſe it will protract if not divert your violent proſecution; certainly governeſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, if you prove as good as your word, I ſhall eſteeme it the greateſt piece of ſervice that ever your wits produced, ſince in my opinion, it not only equalls all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my ſelfe is concerned in the buſineſſe, but out goes the reſt in difficulty, conſidering how many powerfull adverſaries you have to deale withall. Well then ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſit ſtill and heare my propoſitions, and afterwards prepare your ſelfe without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to put them in execution, though never ſo much againſt your appetite; if not returne me ſuch arguments as may convert my judgement as well as ſatisfie your own fancy: <hi>Cloria</hi> told <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> that her injunction was ſo reaſonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, or was not deſperate againſt their own good, promiſing withall to be punctuall in her obedience, as a principall duty ſhe eſteemed her ſelfe bound unto, in regard of that charge ſhe had had ever ſince her infancy over her, and then the old woman began this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe two Suitors ſaid ſhe, that ſeem like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to trouble your patience, and the Kingdomes quiet, ſince the one commands the Army, as the other is poſſeſt of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppoſe their owne intereſt one againſt the other, if you can diſſemblingly but entertaine the love of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by which jealouſie certainly there muſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169951:132"/>needes riſe diſcontents and factions towards your ſafety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain the addreſſes of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> the Souldiers will think their Generall undervalued, who appeares now to the publike view to carry upon the point of his Sword the abſolute power and ſtrength of the whole Kingdome; And if you accept of <hi>Farezius</hi> Courtſhips, no doubt but the Senate will eſteeme their own authorities diſhonoured, ſince they have propoſed Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> to be the ſubject of their chiefe care: Beſides, if <hi>Farezius</hi> ſhould faile in any thing he attempts, many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people would conceive with ſome violence, that the Senate hath an intention to couzen them out of thoſe priviledges, they have been promiſed when their greateſt patron ſhall be debarred of his own deſires, and if <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſhould miſſe of what he hath hitherto expected by the Senates liberall offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Maſters, which would not be leſſened by other jealouſies already growing between the two factions, ſince the Nobility doth not onely with all the ſecret policy they can, ſeek to curbe the inſolency of the common ſort, who ſtrive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to an univerſall equallity, but the multitude have already ſo farre declared their diſlike of the Lords proceedings, that publikely they have required to have the authority of their juriſdiction taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and made lyable to the peoples allowance, who now enjoy their priviledges by inheritance from their Anceſtors, purchaſed either by their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169951:132"/>own merits, or the Princes grace. And laſt of all, though the factions of the two Rivalls ſhould not enflame at the particular diſgrace of either <hi>Caſſianus</hi> or <hi>Farezins,</hi> yet certainly their owne Swords in a private combate would be very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to decide the quarrell, which would give you a faire pretence to refuſe the Survivor that ſhould covet to imbrace you with hands imbrued in bloud.</p>
            <p>Governeſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, although I ſhould be very glad to be an occaſion to raiſe any faction for my own preſent advantage, and my fathers future proſperity, yet I cannot deny but I am moſt extream ſorry to heare of new troubles, whereby the Kingdome ſhould be engaged in more ſlaughters. You are very pittifull replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> but I pray conſider, whether it be not better to procure the diſcompoſure of thoſe that have ſought all this time by their authority to eſtabliſh another government, deſtructive to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, whereby of neceſſity a generall confuſion muſt follow, for that it is not probable ſo many intereſts can be ſatisfied, or give occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Lydia</hi> for the conqueſt of forraigne Forces, ſince it is impoſſible your fathers many children would be content to ſit downe quietly with the perpetuall loſſe of their owne Birth-rights extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during their minorities, and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their dues, ſeeing all the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> are intereſſed as well in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as in their bloud. No, no Madam ſaid ſhe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpence with your unprofitable commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169951:133"/>then be careleſſe of future ſafety, for it will be much better now to deſtroy theſe unlawfull deſignes by a little civill Warres amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that would but purge the Kingdome of its corrupt humours, ingendred by exceſſe in pride and proſperity, then in the times to come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all conditions to a perpetuall ſlavery, under a Tyrannicall government, gained by the power of lawleſſe Souldiers, brought in by other Princes not acquainted with the natures of our people, much leſſe ſenfible of their ſufferings, ſince they will only conſider their faults paſt, and not looke upon their miſeries preſent, for they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judge them by the manner of ſubjection of their own Countrey, then by the ſweetneſſe of the <hi>Lydian</hi> Lawes: Wherefore I ſay you muſt thinke, whether of the two Suitors you will make the object of your choyce, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favours, whereby ſome ſudden difference may ariſe between the factions to bring the ſooner confuſion into the Kingdome, which certainly is the readieſt way againe to eſtabliſh your father in his right, ſince the noyſe of forraigne power at preſent, will not only be an occaſion the better to unite them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Kings diſadvantage, but at the beſt, hazard the deſtruction of all property and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſince the Sword will be the principall Arbitrator of every mans right, and the victory a change of his condition.</p>
            <p>Truly <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, as I cannot in my own reaſon eſteeme your diſcourſe apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, ſo of the other ſide, you cannot deny, but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169951:133"/>that I have been ever willing in all my neceſſities to follow your Counſell, and therefore ſince you have preſcribed the Law; certainly the election will be eaſie; for conſidering that <hi>Farezius</hi> hath not yet publikely pretended to my love, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by any expreſſions to my ſelfe, me thinks it would appeare ſome injuſtice for me to refuſe <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Courtſhips, who hath already as you know a kinde of an ingagement from my own mouth concerning the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> though he be ſince deſtroyed: beſides his bloud, Titles, and condition, more ſuite with my honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdome will have the greater ſhare, whoſe dignities cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if it were not for particular ends, would preſerve Monarchy; whereas the people and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers endeavour nothing more then to deſtroy it from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Why then Princeſſe ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> if you be ſo reſolved, I muſt give you your leſſon; but firſt <hi>I</hi> will tell you of a third Suitor, who alſo as beſt deſerving muſt have ſome imployment, and that is <hi>Creſes;</hi> one whoſe affection might merit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall with your love, if your other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his own diſproportion were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles beyond removall: however, it is your part to truſt his fidelity, and reward his truſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince his endeavours may bring you advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as well as himſelfe preferment. Wherefore I will deſigne him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is preſently to make a Journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> where the Queene your Mother, and the Prince your brother both
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169951:134"/>remaine, to expect the pleaſure of that State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your fathers affaires, by which meanes he ſhall more particularly be able to informe them concerning the Myſtery of your reſolutions that may render the aſſiſtance they ſhall be willing to lend more advantageable, and the rather for that I underſtand the Countrey of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines an Ambaſſadour with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> whoſe force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if they can be made faithfull to <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> good, ſince the leaſt power will infinitely ſtrengthen the faction that ſhall ſhew it ſelfe for the King or his ſonne; and in the Journey I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Creſes</hi> ſhall viſit the <hi>Cretans</hi> ſee whether they may alſo be wrought to joyne with our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here at home, which is not improbable, ſince peace and ſettlement in <hi>Lydia</hi> will be an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to their proſperities, for that thoſe people by this Kingdome are eſteemed no other then pernitious rebells: And let <hi>Creſes</hi> alone to act his part when he is ſufficiently enformed of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, whoſe ſharpe wit and excellent language, cannot be equalled by any meſſenger can be ſent, which are fortunate properties to our purpoſe; beſides his intire love to your ſacred ſelfe, will be alwayes ſure to continue him abſolutely faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which afterward muſt be rewarded, either by your fathers fortunes, or the Queenes intereſt in <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without doubt Governeſſe ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> you have hit upon a right plot, and the rather for that I heare by a late edict ſent from the Senate (as it ſhould ſeeme upon the Kings flight) they have not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169951:134"/>onely baniſhed out of the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> all my fathers friends in generall, but <hi>Creſes</hi> in particular, as conceiving him extraordinarily intereſſed in the Kings counſell and affaires, for that he brought as you know to the Senate the firſt propoſitions of his and the Armies deſires.</p>
            <p>Then Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> your next worke muſt be, anew to invite Prince <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> by ſome hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he ſent you, that you have not yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as alſo upon your diſcourſe to him, when he ſhewed both affection and diligence in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the old <hi>Flamines</hi> life at your requeſt, in which ſervice you expreſt ſo much liking to his perſon and vertues, that you profeſt him the next perſon in your thoughts to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> engagement, whom he will not be perſwaded is living: and I ſhall be very glad ſtill to continue him in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, untill the deſignes we have in hand may happily be brought to ſome fortunate iſſue, by which meanes <hi>Farezius</hi> may be ſpoyled of the peoples affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now ſeemes to carry him up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other authorities, and ſo conſequently enflames his thoughts above oppoſition, in what he ſhall propoſe, much leſſe wiſh; though truly for my part I believe, he hath a ſtrong faction againſt him, not only by the Nobility by reaſon of <hi>Dimogoras</hi> diſgrace, and many of the chiefe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169951:135"/>own deſires in taking away the power from the Lords and deſtroying the Kings regality, yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from complaining.</p>
            <p>Well, well ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> as we muſt leave time to diſcover theſe hidden myſteries, ſo will I addreſſe my ſelfe to put in execution what your wiſdome hath preſcribed, and to that purpoſe muſt enjoyn you to remaine here in my abſence, untill an houres ſpace give you releaſement; in which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim I ſhall endeavour to contrive a Letter to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> (in anſwer to his he ſent me the other day) convenient for our deſigne. But ſcarce had the Princeſſe remained in her private Cabinet the time limitted by her words, but ſhe brought forth a Letter imprinted in a faire character, but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a much fairer hand, which ſhe giving to <hi>Roxana</hi> to reade, it ſpake this language.</p>

Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> make no ſcruple to let him have as much as you can ſpare upon the old ſcore, ſince my Lord <hi>Narciſſus</hi> appearance at any time, will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely blot out the obligation, which you know were the firſt conditions you treated upon in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the old <hi>Flamines</hi> life. I but ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I ſhould be very ſorry any ſuſpected teſtimony did remaine, that ſo much as intimated my thoughts could ever be perſwaded to another choyce. In good ſooth ſaid the old woman; your conſcience is ſo tender in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your ſervant, you will make a doubt, whether he be the ſame man or no, and by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169951:137"/>that meanes call your affection in queſtion to the raiſing of ſome deſperate jealouſie between you. At theſe words the Princeſſe ſmil'd, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in her reply, by the information ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that her dinner waited her pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It was not long after this diſcourſe before <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> himſelfe in perſon came into the Princeſſe Lodgings, not only in confirmation of the truth of his Letter he had ſent, but as it were according to his profeſſion to obraide <hi>Farezius</hi> ſuſpected, if not pretended love, although <hi>Cloria</hi> for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was ſo buſied by reaſon of ſome imployment in her chamber with her maid ſervants, that <hi>Roxana</hi> was conſtrained with ſome complements not only to give him entertainment, but to make her Miſtreſſes excuſe, which at laſt ſeated them both in a withdrawing roome belonging to the Princeſſes lodgings, and that conveniences drew on many diſcourſes; amongſt which <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was perſwaded by the old womans deſires, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the paſſages of his own fortunes, with the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Armenia,</hi> pretended to be injured by the uſurped power of <hi>Artaxes</hi> their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater motive by <hi>Roxana's</hi> meanes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Clorias</hi> affections.</p>
            <p>You muſt know ſaid he, that after the valiant King of <hi>Seythia</hi> had loſt his life in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Warres in defence of the Princes rights, who were eſteemed oppreſſed by <hi>Artaxes</hi> power, a ſtory moſt ſufficiently known to all, my ſelfe came into <hi>Lydia</hi> to demand aſſiſtance of <hi>Euarchus</hi> my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to recover againe my conquered Country of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169951:137"/>
               <hi>Iberia,</hi> detained from me by <hi>Tigranes</hi> Duke of <hi>Colchis. Orſames</hi> alſo at the ſame time began his Warres againſt our oppreſſor with the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſince <hi>Philoſtros</hi> his powerfull Favourite judged it a worke full of piety and juſtice, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he knew there would be much bloud ſpilt in the quarrell, fince as his maſter was mighty, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes</hi> was obſtinate, and both ambitious; And to this purpoſe, not onely proſecuted his deſigne with much violence againſt the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> but in a ſhort time <hi>Orſames</hi> gained many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſo that at laſt, he brought <hi>Artaxes</hi> to be willing to accept, if not to demand a publike Treaty; whereby as twas pretended, <hi>Aſia</hi> againe might be reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a generall peace, ſince the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of ſuch mighty intereſts, ſeemed to thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the whole world with a fatall deſtruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes were called to ſhew forth their accuſtomed priviledges, in a City upon the Confines of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> which was a place choſen as moſt indifferent for that effect: where their Commiſſioners then mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and yet remaining with more diſputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occaſion to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to invite me to flye to their protection, as well for preſent ſubſiſtance, as future hopes, ſince it appeared theſe two powerfull Kings, only beheld their own ambitions as the chiefe object of their conſiderations, though they pretend a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I doe not deſire to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my thoughts with the rights of other Princes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169951:138"/>that have little relation to our affaires, but as they may concerne your particular, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they may prove over tedious for our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded diſcourſe, ſince the Princeſſe her ſelfe will be likely to ſurprize us before we have finiſhed, I muſt intreat the honour only to be made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe things, that ſhall belong to your owne Titles; and the rather for that I have heard ſome diſputes formerly to that purpoſe, which I was not very well able to anſwer, and ſhould be very glad to be better provided againſt other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to ſever in all reſpects the intereſts of other Princes from my own, ſo I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid what unneceſſary diſcourſe may prove either tedious or impertinent; after that <hi>Roxana</hi> had acknowledged the favour by a few complements, he related theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Although I am confident ſaid he, that you are competently informed, that my dead father was diſpoſſeſſed of his fruitfull Countrey of <hi>Iberia</hi> for taking up of Armes againſt the power of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> yet may not be perhaps ſufficiently inſtructed how <hi>Tygranes</hi> became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of our Countries, Titles, and Honours, wherefore be pleaſed to know, that after my ſaid father was driven forcibly from the poſſeſſion of the Crowne of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> (which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the free election of that people, who found themſelves oppreſſed by the Lawes <hi>Artaxes</hi> had impoſed upon their conſciences; as well as many of the Nobility deprived of ſuch Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169951:138"/>to the Temples, in their poſſeſſions, which their predeceſſors had left them, though formerly taken away I muſt confeſſe by violence from the <hi>Flamines</hi>) and my mother forced to flye to her friends charity for ſuccour and ſafety, the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Tygranes</hi> riches, proſecuted ſo farre his begun good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that in a ſhort ſpace he not only quieted the ſtirres in his dominions, but advanced his power into <hi>Iberia,</hi> which being without any ſupport, but what few Forces <hi>Euarchus</hi> his father, then King of <hi>Lydia</hi> had ſend to defend his daughters right, quickly became maſter of what ſtrong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he pleaſed, untill at laſt he was Lord of the whole; and being in poſſeſſion he not only paid that debt he owed to <hi>Tygranes</hi> with part of my Lands, but beſtowed upon him in requitall of his other good ſervices, all our Titles and honours which for many laſting ages had remained in our family, as being the next of kinne. As this cruell injuſtice killed my father with griefe, ſo after ſome yeares it brought to our aſſiſtance the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Scythian</hi> Prince, as one ſent from the Gods in our apprehenſion, to teach <hi>Artaxes</hi> a new law of obedience to the fortunes of ſo great a courage; however this date of life became determined by the envious deſtinies, and we left only to demand ayde of <hi>Orſames</hi> power, to finiſh that work that we thought ſo happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was to be reckoned the chiefe, ſince moſt eminent both in wrongs and honours: As I may ſay my particular cauſe bearing the very name of all the reſt: In this
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169951:139"/>ſigne, the <hi>Syrians</hi> continued a large progreſſe within <hi>Artaxes</hi> Countries, untill the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was forced in a manner by the conſent alſo of <hi>Soraſtros</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to that generall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I formerly mentioned; which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the while hath only produced diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtead of concluſions, for that the War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſtill with violence to the ruine of the whole Kingdome, without the benefit of any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, began at firſt by the obſtinate pride of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi> that would not reſtore thoſe rights belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my ſelfe, which probably might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſatisfaction to the other Princes of our facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; however lately <hi>Tygranes</hi> being alſo oppreſſed by the burthen of warre in his owne dominions, begins to be more plyant to our deſires, and to this purpoſe many arguments are alleadged of either ſide to give colour to the unfortunate acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Souldiers, who are maintained more to fatisfie the ambition of the two mighty Kings, then to put us in poſſeſſion of our rights. <hi>Tygranes</hi> affirmeth, that as the King of <hi>Armenias</hi> gratitude beſtowed upon him in recompence of his ſervices done the Crowne, thoſe honours and Lands that belonged to our Family, ſo the money he hath laid out in the Warres, makes him a lawfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be deprived of them without a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, according to the damage he hath ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe actions. The State of <hi>Syria</hi> againe pretends, that unleſſe my ſelfe be reſtored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with the injured Princes, muſt of neceſſity be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169951:139"/>broken, and ſo conſequently their Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> diſhonoured in their agreement; and we further adde, that although <hi>Artaxes</hi> might have ſome colour of diſpleaſure againſt my father, for taking upon him the Crowne of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and defending the poſſeſſion in his life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet my ſelf ought not to be eſteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and therefore too much injured by ſuch a loſſe, when inſtead of enjoying the greateſt principallity of all <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> for dignity, I am left naked of honour and ſubſiſtance, whilſt others of leſſe quality triumph with thoſe ſpoyles that ſhould adorn my perſon. In concluſion, not to detaine your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation over long with diverſity of relations, although the Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> vowes never to lay downe Armes without a full reſtoration of the Princes rights: yet many Miniſters of that State did underhand conclude a league with <hi>Tygranes</hi> to my prejudice; which ſhewes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt hath the chiefe preheminency in this Warre; but ſince, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from that agreement: in ſo much as the difference may produce better effects; and the rather doe I hope it, for that <hi>Tygranes</hi> hath lately offered to procure the King of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to grant me equall honours to thoſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath loſt, as himſelfe will be content to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the poſſeſſion of the Countries belonging to my right, if a generall peace in all <hi>Aſia</hi> may by that meanes ſucceed; provided he be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ſatisfied by the State for thoſe damages he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:169951:140"/>hath ſuſteined by the Warres; in which poſture continue our preſent affaires; without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world.</p>
            <p>Truly my Lord anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> it ſeemes to me, nothing more is demanded in the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia</hi> then what you have been pleaſed to mention, ſince your intereſt is the baſes, upon which the only occaſion of the Warre hath been builded. It is true ſaid <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> however ſome differences in points of religion that the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſtand upon, is a kinde of an obſtacle alſo; yet it is thought, the State of <hi>Syria</hi> can when it pleaſeth, moderate that particular: but the truth is, that thoſe contentions that depend upon <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> are of ſo much conſequence to this Treaty, that it abſolutely hinders not only the progreſſe, but ſucceſſe of all the reſt, whoſe ambitions as 'tis thought can never be ſatisfied; untill one of thoſe States periſh from its appearing greatneſſe; by which meanes the other may appeare to the world more abſolute.</p>
            <p>By this time the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> came into the roome, which for the preſent not only broake off their diſcourſe, but gave warning to <hi>Caſſianus</hi> to preſent himſelfe to his moſt glorious Miſtreſſe, as the chiefeſt deity his heart pretended to adore; however, ſhe, as if nature as well as art had taught a more beſeeming quickneſſe then ordinary, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with thoſe inſtructions ſhe had received from her Governeſſe that gave her confidence, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her kinſmans addreſſes with theſe words:</p>
            <p>Couſin ſaid ſhe, if my neceſſary imployment
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169951:140"/>hath made me ſeem rude in that entertainment your kinde viſit merited from me, I muſt deſire you, rather to interpret my omiſſion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption I had in thoſe tyes that have united us in bloud, then any fault my governeſſe hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in my education, upon which ſcore I am bold to aske your pardon, for your over long ſtay in expecting my company. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> finding himſelfe ſaluted in this manner, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to cuſtome, but his own expectation, ſince formerly all her diſcourſes were rather markes of civility, then teſtimonies of affection; ſtood ſome time amazed, as if his imagination could not be ſatisfied in that truth which his eares heard utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But after he had a little put off that pleaſing diſtraction that anew captivated his ſenſes, though in a trembling poſture, he returned her this anſwer.</p>
            <p>Truly Madam ſaid he, if the greateſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the world had been ſo bountifully repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for whole ages of attendance upon ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a goddeſſe, certainly he would have made no queſtion of his ſatisfaction, but rather have given his whole domination of the earth for ſuch a purchaſe; much leſſe muſt I eſteem my ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured that only live by your pleaſure. O my Lord anſwered the Princeſſe, ſince your expreſſions flye ſo high a pitch, I ſhall begin to think it neceſſary to defend my reputation againſt your comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but yet upon better conſideration, I am of opinion it is much ſafer to confeſſe my ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by your courtefie, then venture more blowes in counequall a combate, where your wit
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169951:141"/>will be ſure to have the victory: And with theſe words taking him by the hand ſhe led him into a faire Balcony that had a large proſpect over the goodly River of <hi>Pactole,</hi> where long they had not remained (the Princeſſe in the meane time caſting her eyes downe the River, upon whoſe bankes was ſeated that pleaſant houſe of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that firſt gave <hi>Caſſianus</hi> entertainment when he came into <hi>Lydia</hi>) before ſhe uſed this language, though a ſweet ſhower of teares opened the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for her words: I cannot ſaid ſhe but with ſome griefe remember the innocent times that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place, when my Father ſeemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately metamorphoſed into a Garriſon of Souldiers, who perchance neither honour dignity, nor know goodneſſe, much leſſe practiſe vertue.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſaid <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> as I muſt confeſſe thoſe reſpects I then received from your moſt noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my affectionate Uncle were farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my poore deſerts, which gives me more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at preſent to lament his condition, in being Subject to ſuch a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I cannot alſo but remember my own loſſes at that time, ſince even then I quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the liberty of my ſoule, that untill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I could never recover againe; though I have ſought all wayes of redemption; and unleſſe you prove more mercifull then the Kings oppreſſors, I ſhall not only remaine in as great a captivity, but have cauſe to accuſe you of the like Tyranny, though I dare not be ſo bold in my complaints.</p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:169951:141"/>
            <p>But yet Couſin ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I muſt make a great deal of difference in the nature of your ſufferings, though I ſhould grant the quality; for as the King hath by all meanes poſſible ſtrived to give his oppreſſors ſatisfaction, provided it may not be againſt the right of his Succeſſors, and good of his people; ſo you of the other ſide violently ayme at your own content, to the injuring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of anothers Title. Alas Madam anſwered <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> was I not your firſt and laſt lover? the ſilent rocks can give ſufficient teſtimonies of the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, only to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witneſſe the other: by my importunities; wherefore no intereſt is to be eſteemed equall to my pretentions, either in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or right.</p>
            <p>Alaſſe, alaſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, you never let me know thoſe powerfull affections before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects had taken full poſſeſſion of that heart which became alſo in ſome ſort a priſoner not to be releaſed, who perhaps might as well have been your Captive, if your omiſſions had not proved moſt unfortunate to your purpoſes. And whereas you ſay, you are my laſt lover, I beſeech you doe but conſider <hi>Farezius</hi> intentions, and looke upon his actions, and you will finde both violence and power hath diſcovered a later ſceane, then what you moved in, when you ſaved the old <hi>Flamins</hi> life, ſo that I muſt tell you, that unleſſe punctually you obſerve the condition according to your former agreement, which was never to preſſe my love to any concluſion, if <hi>Narciſſus</hi> were living,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169951:142"/>to whoſe living, to whoſe memory I muſt ſtill obſerve that decorum, I vow by the gods never to entertaine any motions from your addreſſes, much leſſe give any conſent to a future marriage; beſides you muſt performe thoſe actions that may render you capable of ſatisfaction, as my ſelfe freedome in granting; which can never be as long as the Generall hath opportunity to prevent and power to conſtraine. Wherefore in briefe, you are to ſtudy ſome oppoſition anſwerable to his greatneſſe for both our advantages, whereby the better to merit my love, as to ſhew your ſelfe worthy the name of a Prince of ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſcourſes of <hi>Cloria</hi> could not chuſe but nettle the ears of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> towards the reſolution of ſufficient ambitions; ſince hitherto he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelfe to have been over ſloathfull, as well in her love as his own honour; ſo that ſtanding ſome time in a deep muſe, as if he intended to fetch his determinations from his very ſoule, at laſt he broake out into this language: Moſt faire and wiſe Princeſſe ſaid he, as already I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed my beſt endeavours with the expence of my deare bloud (in which you have the deareſt intereſt) in your ſervice againſt the proud Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; ſo I muſt be preſcribed by your directions to ſuch limitations and performances as I am to obſerve for feare, that elſe my actions may either endanger your ſafety to be more valued then the worlds Empire, or ruine your Fathers hopes, whoſe ſufferings cannot be exampled. Therefore I beſeech you let me know how farre your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169951:142"/>may travell in that journey I intend to make againſt the pride of ambitious <hi>Farezius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Couſin ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> as I ſhall leave my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes experience to treat with you about the particulars, ſo of the other ſide, I am content to give you theſe aſſurances of my affections, that after <hi>Narciſſus</hi> you ſhall have the next place in my conſideration, provided you think of my Fathers ſufferings, and be mindfull of your own honour, ſince without him I cannot give away my ſelfe, and without your reputation you are but halfe a Prince. Upon theſe conditions you ſhall find my Lodgings ever ready to entertaine your viſits, ſo they may be ſeaſonable and not ſcandalous, which I believe are favours ſufficient to nouriſh your hopes, according to thoſe expreſſions you received under my hand in that Letter, your ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neglect of my condition forced from me, which is all for the preſent I have to ſay upon this theame, unleſſe it be to adde to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how is it poſſible you can either reape fruits from my affection, if <hi>Farezius</hi> continue great? or what probability have you again to recover your loſt Country of <hi>Iberia,</hi> if all regality be ſuppreſt? ſince in the one his greatneſſe may perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me to an unwilling conſent for my owne preſervation, as the other by this meanes may ſo fill <hi>Lydia</hi> with popular deſires, that your birth and bloud, much leſſe dignity ſhall finde no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in their conſiderations. Wherefore I ſay, joyn your thoughts only to ſuch deſignes as ſhall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of <hi>Syria;</hi> wherein the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſeem alſo to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169951:143"/>have a ſhare, in regard the Lords governe all in their Country, and by that meanes you will beſt pleaſe my deſires.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Caſſianus</hi> could not diſprove the Princeſſe Rhetorick, for that it taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto altogether followed, ſince he more looked upon his own private concernments, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Uncles enemies, then thoſe rights that belonged to the dignity and honour of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which number himſelfe was eminent by bloud and alliance: yet in regard of thoſe hopes that <hi>Cloria</hi> gave him by her faire language, and good entertainment, he was ſufficiently pleaſed with her diſcourſe, for that it ſpake at leaſtwiſe liking, if not love to his eares: however, it ſeemed mixt with ſome reſerved conditions, which he was content only to interpret baſhfull aſſurances, though the gods were privy to other intentions, that could not be altered; wherefore as if joyfully aſſured by the Princeſſes words, and impatient of more delay to put in execution what he was enjoyned after he had returned humble thanks not only for her free expreſſions, but the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe had in his ſervices, with ſome other complements belonging to his love, and fit for the ſeaſon, kiſſing her faire hands he tooke his leave, vowing the abſolute performance of all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the uttermoſt of his power: but being gone, the Princeſſe uſed theſe words to <hi>Roxana,</hi> fearing belike her own diſſimulation was too great a crime.</p>
            <p>Doe you believe ſaid ſhe, that the gods will be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169951:143"/>content with my hypocriſie, in making this poor Princes affections, a ſtale to our other purpoſes, ſince you know my vertuous engagements are ſo farre from ſuffering me to become his wife, that my heart dares fcarce think of ſuch a perſwaſion in any kinde; and as little ſhould I be willing ſuch a report ſhould reach the eares of abſent <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> who perhaps will accuſe my conſtancy for having only deceived, in that nature for his better advantage: no no <hi>Roxana</hi> be confident, as plaine dealing is beſt in all morall actions, ſo certainly in love the contrary procures either hate, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or deſpaire, which may produce effects dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if not deſtructive. After the old woman with a kind of ſmile had heard out her Miſtreſſes diſcourſe, ſhe returned her this anſwer.</p>
            <p>As I cannot deny ſaid ſhe, but diſſimulation in it ſelfe, is a flattering vice that ſteales upon many diſpoſitions with certaine poſſible if not probable ſignes of lawfulneſſe, becauſe they are contented to be perſwaded by their imaginations, they meane no hurt in their intention, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I muſt confeſſe, deſtroyes all morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; yet in all reſpects of the contrary, for a perſon to uncover his breaſt upon every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without leaving himſelfe a defence againſt his crafty enemy, were a madneſſe capable to ruine his fortunes as often as the opportunity preſented the meanes. Wherefore Madam, in the generall I can only give this rule, when a body is left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether he will ſpeak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then ſo much as intimate a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by his words, or in friendly converſation
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169951:144"/>appeare not candid and ſatisfactory: but if in deepe examinations that may produce great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art poſſible may be uſed to avoyde the determination, provided a direct untruth be not admitted; or the damage of a third party ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the concealement.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, for that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this diſcourſe for my ſatisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my caſe with my Couſin, whom you ſee I have wonne into a beliefe of what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intend. Tis true ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> however it doth not appeare you have engaged your ſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words or actions; and therefore it is not any thing you have done hath conſtrained or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his beliefe; wherefore it ought only to reſt upon the fault of his own fancy, if he prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Beſides, it may be conſidered, that as he hath been ſome part of the occaſion of your ſuffering unjuſtly, ſo is it fit he ſhould endure a little pennance for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and put caſe it may be granted that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the Letter you wrote him, wherein you ſeeme to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite his addreſſes to a new Courtſhip, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed falſe, for that you may have a reſolution to entertaine his affection, if my Lord <hi>Narciſſus</hi> (whom the Gods defend) ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry. I but there Governeſſe, replyed <hi>Cloria</hi> lyes hidden the deceit, ſince my reſolutions are fixed never to make any other choyce in life or death. Why then anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> at the worſt you doe but like an honeſt perſon in danger to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169951:144"/>that takes ſome liberty to make thieves fall out, whereby to be the better ſecured: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> cannot be prejudiced by the practice, but on the contrary reape benefit, for that his fortunes ſeem to depend upon regallity and Nobility, which the rude multitude would deſtroy; I ſee no reaſon why you ſhould poſſeſſe your thoughts with ſuch ſcruples. Well, well ſaid the Princeſſe, as you are my Governeſſe, in this doubt I will perſwade my conſcience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your principles; however, the gods may puniſh us both for our over-much boldneſſe, thus to play too freely with thoſe injunctions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne religion; or at leaſtwiſe may have ſome relation to it; however, I cannot deny, but that there is a neceſſity in my diſſimulation at this preſent; and the rather am I content a little to practice the faculty, for that I know <hi>Caſſianus</hi> can ſuſtaine no prejudice by my intentions.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe and other reaſons which <hi>Roxana</hi> uſed at divers times, proved ſufficient motives to retaine her miſtreſſe firme in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their deſignes; yet underſtanding by <hi>Creſes</hi> amongſt other diſcourſes, that the Duke of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> was dead, ſhe could not in ſome ſort but be doubtfull of the ſafety of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> for that they had heard nothing from him ſince his ſeparation; however, ſhe was extreamly carefull to keep theſe thoughts from entering into the boſome of the already too much troubled Princeſſe, though in the interim ſhe omitted no opportunity whereby to inſtruct <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in that part he was to play by their appointment againſt <hi>Farezius.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Caſſianus</hi> as I ſaid, having received both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from <hi>Cloria,</hi> and inſtructions by <hi>Roxana,</hi> conſulted oftentimes with himſelfe as well as with her how he might beſt put them in execution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laſt he fell upon this reſolution; that as <hi>Dimogoras</hi> his truſty friend, had been moſt injur'd by the preferment of <hi>Farezius,</hi> having outed him of his place and command in the Army, ſo would he be the fitteſt perſon to be communicated with all, concerning the likelieſt way to proſecute his deſignes, according to the directions he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: To this effect he intended to make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the hopes he had lately received to obtaine the favour of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> in his pretended love; The rather for that he knew he was not only a man who had a principall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt among the Nobility and chiefe Senators, but was alſo extreamly beloved in the Army, by moſt of the common Souldiers, that were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute creatures of <hi>Farezius:</hi> wherefore one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before <hi>Dimogoras</hi> was gone out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Caſſianus</hi> came unto him with a ſmiling countenance, and this language in his mouth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dimogoras</hi> ſaid he, as it were ſomething imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent againe for me, to reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavours, ſince they are not only generally knowne to all the world, but divers times have been acknowledged by my expreſſions in particular: ſo my buſineſſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is to make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions concerning ſome late paſſages: I came into <hi>Lydia</hi> as you know by your procurement to proſecute my affections to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169951:145"/>the faire Princeſſe the Kings daughter when ſhe was taken priſoner by the Senates Fleet in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game.</hi> Tis true my courtſhips in that nature, were ſomething retarded, if not abſulutely laid aſide untill the preſent, by reaſon of a certaine correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency between her, and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſonne: This gives me occaſion to tell you, that however I found her then backward to my wiſhes; either proceeding from her flattering fancy that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was living, or conceiving her own condition was much more ſecure in the Senates cuſtody, then at preſent under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Army and Souldiers, or rather I may ſay being violently preſt to ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by reaſon of the extraordinary greatneſſe, (both in command and authority) of <hi>Farezius,</hi> who as it ſhould ſeem pretends ſomething vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to her love and affection; Now ſhe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more tractable, and willing to entertaine thoſe proteſtations of mine, whoſe effects I have ever conſecrated to her ſervice, ſince I had the honour to be entertained by the good will of the <hi>Lydian</hi> people: I need not trouble you much with the repetitions of your own received injuries by reaſon of the generalls greatneſſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all thoſe gallant ſervices, which you have performed, in the defence and ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, neither ſhall I mention the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereby, that threaten a kind of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to all the Nobility of the Kingdome; for that I know your judgement, and their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, cannot poſſbly be wanting in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: only I muſt needs tell you that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:169951:146"/>
               <hi>Cloria</hi> her ſelfe, extreamly wonders how it is poſſible, you ſhould diſpence ſo much with your honour and reputation as to beare thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities that have caſt you from your authority and command, with ſuch an extreame quiet paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? Are the Nobility ſaid he of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſo much degenerated in their ſoules and ſpirits, as eaſily in this manner to quit their honour, to the loweſt conditions the people ſhall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of mind, once ſo frequently raigning in the breaſts of the better ſort of men in this Kingdome, that is now loſt in a chaos of confuſion with the rabble or common multitude? doth a little ſenſuall feare, bury all conſiderations of valour and gallantry in this Nation? people being only given to eate and drinke, without affectation of greatneſſe or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of diſgrace: If it be ſo my Lord in the generall, my words will be as much in vaine to be uttered, as your life in effect will be miſerable in the future: but I have more confidence in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> both for his own ſake and my good: This being ſaid, <hi>Caſſianus</hi> reſted ſilent to heare what reply <hi>Dimogoras</hi> would make.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dimogoras</hi> I may ſay continued altogether mute for ſomething a long ſpace: his eyes ſparkling out in the interim nevertheleſſe a certaine kinde of ſeeming deſire of revenge, though his body o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrowne with fleſh and humour, appeared not to be much inclinable to action: but being wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome determinate anſwer, by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> (who belike himſelfe had been ſtrongly urged by <hi>Roxana,</hi> to be ſpeedy in the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169951:146"/>execution of her deſigne) at laſt he blutterd out this reply.</p>
            <p>My Lord ſaid he, I muſt confeſſe, that both my ſelfe and the reſt of the Nobility of <hi>Lydia</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Princeſſes apprehenſion, (whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther however I love not, nor ever ſhall) have wound their dignities and honours, into ſuch a labyrinth of inconvenience, by complying ſo much with the violent, and confuſed humours of the common people, that we have in a manner ſuffered <hi>Farezius</hi> with the reſt of his faction, to overthrow already the moſt eſſentiall part of our hereditary honours and priviledges; and by that meanes are become leſſe powerfull, to act any thing with advantage either to our ſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: nevertheleſſe perhaps, I may yet ſet on foot ſomething of faction amongſt the Souldiers, (if they have not wholly loſt the remembrance, that I once commanded amongſt them) that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance produce effects tending to thoſe purpoſes you have deſigned: with theſe words he entered into ſome rage and paſſion, as it were out of the very apprehenſion of his own loſſe of reputation, in being ſo diſgracefully turned out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: preſently after this he tooke his leave of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> as pretending he would goe to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to try his friends conſtitutions concerning thoſe deſignes he intended:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was glad he had got thus much from his reſolutions (for notwithſtanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have ſome cauſe to ſuſpect his activity) ſo that he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe alſo, to uſe the beſt intereſt he had,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:169951:147"/>both with the Lords and the reſt of the Senators, whom he knew to be of a contrary faction to <hi>Farezius:</hi> withall he had upon all occaſions free admittance into the Princeſſes lodgings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her own allowance and <hi>Roxana's</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which as it may be thought, ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented his apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>It was not long before <hi>Dimogoras</hi> and the reſt of the Nobility, raiſed conſiderable factions and mutinies in the Army, amongſt the Souldiers, they alſo being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other conditions promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them upon their firſt taking up Armes againſt the King, being ſince renewed againe to their hopes, when he was delivered out of priſon, by ſome Troopes ſent to that purpoſe, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called away both <hi>Farezius</hi> and <hi>Hercrombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to the appeaſing of the ſtirs.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Farezius,</hi> did with faire language and promiſing words in a ſhort ſpeech, ſeemingly pacifie moſt of their diſcontents, yet <hi>Hercombrotus,</hi> who was of a more violent and active nature, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many of the Troopes continue ſtill their mutinies, and inſolencies againſt their command, ſuddenly flew in amongſt thoſe Souldiers with fury in his looks, and terrour in his countenance, where preſently ſeizing upon two or three of thoſe that appeared moſt refractory and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, he delivered them inſtantly over to officers to be executed and puniſhed: After this he not only offered a free pardon to the reſt, but alſo promiſed them a reall performance of all their juſt expectations, provided that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:169951:147"/>they would continue obedient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their affections.</p>
            <p>After this, when both <hi>Farezius</hi> and <hi>Hercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> were on their way againe towards the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> an officer of the Army began this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Generall: Sir ſaid he, by this late mutiny, you may ſee the danger not only of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoras</hi> intereſt amongſt the Souldiers, but the power he hath with thoſe of the better ſort of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; from which originall, I ſuppoſe, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in part theſe now appeaſed troubles in the Campe: of the other ſide can you poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that after ſo many teſtimonies of diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King, he will be ever brought to be either entire for the Souldiers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or be weaned from that affection without reaſon, he hath alwayes expreſſed to be in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for his falſe and ungratefull country men the <hi>Myſſians?</hi> in like manner, with what confidence can we any more truſt the actions of the wealthy City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> when as they did not only refuſe, to open their purſes to our occaſions in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſities, but denyed us enterance into their Towne, by the perſwaſion of thoſe Senators that we have now ſent to baniſhment? Theſe things being granted to be true, the next conſideration ought to be had of the remedy for future preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In the firſt place, to compaſſe our deſignes, and procure our ſecurity, we muſt endeavour to joyne with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leaſtwiſe make them ſo by the Souldiers power, who may paſſe an abſolute decree, to have no more Treaties with the King, in regard that thoſe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169951:148"/>hopes and feares, doe not a little diſtract the whole Kingdome, from relying abſolutely upon our commands and juriſdiction, as you know moſt neceſſary for the peoples ſafety: in the next place we are totally to ſuppreſſe the intereſt of <hi>Dimogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> for the preſent, and the Nobillities priviledges in the future, which as I muſt tell you keep up ſuch an opinion amongſt all ſorts of people, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their greatneſſe and ſtabillity, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either for the Kingdomes good or the Armies advantage: Laſtly, we muſt not only drive the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners out of our Country, who only wait occaſions to ſuck up all the benefit to themſelves and Nation, which the <hi>Lydians</hi> at any time ſhall either fight or toyle for, but in ſome terrifying way or other procure money from the Citizens of <hi>Sardis,</hi> whereby to give juſt and fitting content to thoſe faithfull and loving Souldiers, that have fought ſo many bloudy Battels, and obtained multitudes of ſignall victories in their Countreyes behalfe, againſt their numerous enemies.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Farezius</hi> by reaſon of his melancholly and ſilent nature, made no great reply at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to thoſe reaſons that had been delivered, yet it was not many dayes after their arrivall at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> before an abſolute decree paſſed the Senate, that not only there ſhould be no more Treaties, or addreſſes made unto <hi>Euarchus,</hi> concerning any agreement either in the generall or particular, but it was alſo ordered, that it ſhould be eſteemed a crime of a moſt high conſequence, for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much as to make tender of any propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169951:148"/>to that effect, to the reſt of the Senators there aſſembled: which reſolution was quickly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed over the whole Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> by a formall proclamation.</p>
            <p>Of the other ſide <hi>Dimogoras</hi> finding, both his intereſt in the Army and his credit with the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did not any way ſuit with his ambition and expectation, upon the very apprehenſion (as twas thought) of theſe apparant diſgraces, in a very few dayes ended his life in this world; however there were ſome that not only gave it out, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he had been poyſoned, to prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdome: This alſo gave occaſion to Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very ſhort time after, to quit perſonally the Country of <hi>Lydia,</hi> as perhaps ſuppoſing, now his chiefe friend and Favourite <hi>Dimogoras</hi> was gone, and the reſt of the Lords not being in a capacity to ſupport his honour and deſignes, againſt the Souldiers, in the Princeſſe <hi>Clorias</hi> behalfe, it was to little purpoſe any longer to proſecute his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe the Nobillity, with many other of the Senators of the ſame faction, prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to give the body of <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> moſt ſtately and glorious Funerals: To this intent, when the day came, all attired in black, they met the corps with a world of ceremony, and ſo conducted it through a multitude of people, to the place or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for that purpoſe, where being placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of other Generalls, the flames quickly conſumed the pyles whilſt that which was immortall, had a farther account to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:169951:149"/>give, concerning his actions and thoughts during his life.</p>
            <p>When the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> underſtood of this ſtrange and unexpected law, not only pronounced in the Senate, but publiſhed all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhe began now to repent her, of her too much beliefe given to the Kings enemies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any perſwaſion whatſoever, ſhe had entertained in her thoughts; and conſequently had more cauſe a great deale to doubt her owne ſecurity, having no other defence left her but what ſhe could gather from the faithfull and wiſe Councells of her intruſted governeſſe <hi>Roxana,</hi> which was the occaſion, that one day having for the moſt part ſpent her whole ſtore of paſſion, ſhe uſed this kinde of deſpairing diſcourſe unto her.</p>
            <p>Truly <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid ſhe, as there might be noted at firſt, a ſtrong jealouſie amongſt the Souldiers, by the ſtrict gard ſet upon the Kings perſon, ſo this laſt action makes me feare, that there is ſome prevailing deſigne, as well againſt our liberties as his dominion, which we ſhall be ſcarce able to prevent by any induſtry or aſſiſtance; for as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rely much upon the Lords power, by reaſon they have altogether loſt their authority, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their intereſts at the firſt from their Princes prerogative, nothing but to comply with their own ambition and ſpleen; ſo is there as little to be hoped for, from the endeavours of this great and rich City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> conſidering their late carriages, when <hi>Farezius</hi> with his triumphant Army, not only entered their Walls without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but were content to receive his abſolute
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:169951:149"/>commands, without the leaſt diſpute, belonging to their long enjoyed priviledges, never as yet queſtioned by any former Prince or power; theſe repreſentations being knowne and granted to be the effects of the late tranſactions, what probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remaine, for the recovery of my fathers rights, though it ſhould be opinionated, that we our ſelves were out of all danger perſonally; ſince the Kings party appears, not to have either abillity or will to doe him good; And <hi>Lydia</hi> being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united under the preſent juriſdiction, what forraigne induſtry and endeavour ſoever, can worke any conſiderable effects to his advantage? conſidering the many brave Veſſels and ſhipping that are alwayes ready for defence and reſiſtance, upon the <hi>Carian</hi> and <hi>Ionian</hi> ſhoares, to oppoſe either ſudden invaſion or continued hoſtility.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Roxana</hi> had for ſome time reſted ſilent with teares in her eyes, ſhe returned her this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Lady ſaid ſhe, you muſt then give me leave to blame your ſuperſtitious modeſty (as I may call it) in not ſuffering your Uncle <hi>Orſames</hi> to have performed thoſe ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at <hi>Memphis;</hi> which perhaps in part if not totally, would have prevented theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
            <p>Indeed Governeſſe replyed the Princeſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps you eſteeme thoſe decorums of fitting duty, which I ſhall be ever ready to render my Father and Mother, but baſhfull ſuperſtitions, yet I can aſſure you, I ſhall never be ſo much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my own honour, as rather not a thouſand times to venture my deereſt life, then to give away
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169951:150"/>my ſelfe to any love whatſoever, without their inward conſent and publike approbation: but let us for the preſent leave that ſubject, and only fall upon the conſideration, or the meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King may be redeemed from his miſeries, which Rhetorick would not only farre better pleaſe my eares, but be a much more profitable diſcourſe in my opinion, ſince in the other point, I am reſolved ſtill to remaine obſtinate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any perſwaſion to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Truly ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I muſt needs confeſſe, the thing it ſelfe is difficult to bring about and the wayes more uncertaine to know how; ſo of the other ſide, I am ſo farre from believing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the Kings reſtoration to his ancient dignity, that according to my owne thoughts I ſhall give you very probable reaſons, whereby to perſwade you to it, if my fancy doth not much out goe my judgement.</p>
            <p>For although I cannot deny, but that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Lydia</hi> being throughly united under a well ſetled government, with the addition of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Caria,</hi> that afford ſo many conſiderable havens, furniſhed with multitude of ſhipping, is a condition ſcarce to be attempted by any power; yet conſidering the impatience of the peoples na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with the daily oppreſſions of them by the heavy weight of Taxations, a quick diviſion will be wrought in the hearts of thoſe, that muſt of neceſſity be wonne to the change of lawes, and government before the ancient conſtitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived happily for ſo many ages) can be totally taken away:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169951:150"/>However for the preſent, perhaps either feare or hope exerciſes ſo farre mens thoughts, that hardly as yet have they leaſure for conſideration: but when as, I ſay, they ſhall finde this is like to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, they will with much violence deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their old ſubjection, though at firſt they were fooliſhly perſwaded to ſeeke a new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And more eſpecially if thoſe two great Monarchs of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> once make that accord, that all <hi>Aſia</hi> attends with a greedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which may ſoon be effected, ſince the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> hath already agreed with his diſcontented Princes, and alſo hath condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give ſatisfaction to the <hi>Scythian</hi> Crowne, whereby to deliver his Countrey abſolutely from that power, that hath ſo many yeares moleſted it with its armes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, what will thoſe agreements conduce to my fathers benefit, when every Prince regards only his own concernments? beſides their extreame jealouſie of one anothers glory will not ſuffer them to undertake any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt joyntly: And put caſe they ſhould accord conſtantly in their purpoſes, yet when the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> ſhall ſee themſelves ready to be invaded by a forraigne power, they will certainly more ſtrongly conforme their obediences, to this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction they now live under, whereby the better to prevent a new threatning danger.</p>
            <p>It is true ſaid <hi>Roxana</hi> untill the Subjects be made more deſperate in their ſufferings, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be content to truſt ſtrangers with their liberty; but yet the aſſiſtance that is deſired
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169951:151"/>from forraigne Princes needs not to conſiſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in numerous Armies, but in ſmall and frequent ſupplies both of men and moneyes, which joyned with the Kings party, and laying hold of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcontents already ingendred in the hearts of moſt, cannot but conduce exceedingly to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of this new government. Beſides there is another benefit that may be expected from other Countreyes, being at open difference with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Lydia;</hi> and that is, denying their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants the liberty of Trade within their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which at laſt muſt of neceſſity diſcontent and impoveriſh the rich City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> from whence the Souldiers are (if not mainteined) at leaſtwiſe ſupplyed upon all urgent occaſions.</p>
            <p>But why anſwered <hi>Cloria</hi> may not theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and eſpecially the two great Monarchs of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> as well forbid the free commerce you ſpeak of in the time of their own differences, as when they ſhall be at peace between themſelves, if they have any intention to right my father, as I have heard they doe pretend?</p>
            <p>Becauſe, replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> they are both ſo full of their own ambition, that neither dares offend the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> as yet, untill their Warres be at an end between themſelves, leaſt they might give too much advantage to each other by the aſſiſtance of ſo powerfull a Kingdome as this is.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Princeſſe, there may be ſome hopes to better my fathers affaires, when theſe Kings ſhall thinke it good to put up their bloudy ſwords, and not before.</p>
            <p>I conclude not ſo Madam, anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:169951:151"/>for although theſe exaſperated Princes againſt their own quiet ſhould have neither temper in their actions, nor finde wiſedome in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, untill meere neceſſity ſhould conſtraine their Subjects to ſeek peace with violence, which were too dangerous a preſident; yet it is to be hoped that the <hi>Myſſians</hi> with the <hi>Cretan</hi> Forces joyned to the diſcontents of <hi>Lydia,</hi> by reaſon of diverſity of Religions and intereſts would in time reſtore the King to his ancient dignity.</p>
            <p>Piſh <hi>Roxana,</hi> replyed <hi>Cloria;</hi> for the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> I have ſo little confidence in their aſſiſtance, that what countenance ſoever their actions put on, I can ſcarce be perſwaded of their intentions, ſince they once ſold my father to this miſery he now undergoes; when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have redeemed both his perſon, and his Crowne; And for the <hi>Cretans,</hi> beſides that they are of a different profeſſion to ours concerning the worſhip of the gods; there are alſo ſo many factions amongſt them by way of private ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they rather goe backe daily in their own affaires, then ſhew any probabillity of helping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And for the diſcontents of <hi>Lydia</hi> which you mention, with their diverſities of Religions, I doe not finde upon all occaſions, but they can very well lay downe their own ſpleenes, when there appears a neceſſity to oppoſe my fathers proſperity: Laſtly, concerning the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſufferings, I am perſwaded, they are reſolved to endure any ſubjection, or almoſt bondage it ſelfe, rather then to be willing the King ſhould recover againe his loſt rights, by force and power
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169951:152"/>of the ſword, without making firſt ſome conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his prorogative, notwithſtanding he hath divers times, given them by proteſtations, what aſſurances could be deſired from a juſt, and a religious Prince.</p>
            <p>Madam, anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> your opinion I muſt confeſſe is grounded upon a great deale of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity, conſidering how the <hi>Myſſians</hi> not onely ſold the King to the power of the Senate, but at the firſt beginning of theſe troubles came into <hi>Lydia</hi> to diſpute your fathers rights: But yet if you pleaſe to conſider, that the reaſon of their actions then proceeded from the extreame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of ſome eminent perſons amongſt them who finde now they can expect no more gaine (the Senate having already compaſſed their ends upon them) you will eaſily believe, that they are reſolved to change the ſceane for your fathers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſince by that meanes they may come to play a double game, and winne by the bargaine: Next concerning the <hi>Cretans</hi> although I muſt confeſſe their fooliſh diviſions amongſt themſelves have not only much hindred the Kings affaires, and in a manner indangered the whole frame of their own deſignes, yet is there ſuch a diſparity betweene them, and the people of <hi>Lydia,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly of much of their Lands; that they will dye to the laſt man, rather then ſuffer the Senate to beare rule over them: Thirdly, I muſt deſire you not to dwell too ſtrictly upon your beliefe, that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Lydia</hi> will ſo eaſily accord their difference,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169951:152"/>and pacifie their diſcontents, upon the appearance of a ſtrange Army; in regard it will only bring with it the right of the cauſe, with a promiſe of amendment; eſpecially when they ſhall by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more experience finde, that their preſent grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances have neither termination nor limitation; For I ſay, that as at the firſt they were perſwaded to entertaine the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> whom they moſt hated, and feared of all other Nations, againſt their King, who oppreſſed them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, however their fancies did injure their judgements, ſo will they as well accept of any forraigne aſſiſtance againſt the Senate, when they can no longer endure the burthen of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: And laſt of all give me leave to tell you, that the diviſions within the Army and Senate houſe, cannot but produce ſtrange effects, ſince no ſpleen is ſo great, as what is in gendred by the ſame faction, when once they fall at odds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of gaine or prerogative: But as ſhe was further proceeding in her diſcourſe, the dwarfe enformed them, that there was newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Caſtle hall a young Maid of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty, who deſired with much earneſtneſſe, to be brought preſently into the Princeſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as pretending ſhe had ſome ſecret to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not convenient to be imparted to any other eare; he alſo ſaid, that as her eyes ſparkled forth a kinde of youthfull Majeſty, ſo did her neglectfull dreſſe, ſeeme to have been diſordred by her late journey, which made her appeare more <hi>Amazon</hi> like.</p>
            <p>This ſtrange advertiſement put them both into
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169951:153"/>a ſollicitous conſideration, as well concerning the perſon of the party, as the occaſion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; And many loving deſires would gladly have perſwaded poor <hi>Cloria,</hi> that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had borrowed another diſguize, to have given her a new viſit: but having more exactly examined her little ſervant concerning all particulars, ſhe found the ſtranger neither in ſtature or countenance could agree with the proportion or features of her abſent Lord: Wherefore after ſome more diſpleaſing conſideration, with a kinde of a ſad voyce, as if her thoughts were troubled at the miſtake, ſhe commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her preſence.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the damoſell entred the room, with confidence enough, approaching neerer to the Princeſſe in an abrupt manner, told her though ſoftly in her eare, that her new gueſt was no other but her brother <hi>Aſcanius</hi> broake from his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment under the Senates juriſdiction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſht her for ſome time to diſcharge her dwarfe, that he might more freely diſcourſe to her his adventures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cloria</hi> was ſo much confounded with a ſudden joy, to have her ſweet brother in her poſſeſſion, whom ſhe could not be permitted to ſee during their impriſonment; that her diſtractions could ſcarce finde a way, to put in execution, what her owne judgement, ſhould have thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at another ſeaſon: But at laſt breaking through her pleaſant amazement, ſhe diſcharged her little officer; for however ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to truſt him in her own ſecrets, yet ſhe would
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169951:153"/>not notwithſtanding uſe any priviledge to hazard her brothers confidence, leaſt it might render him leſſe aſſured of his ſafety: When ſhe had paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately demonſtrated his welcome, by many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate kiſſes, taking his white hand in hers, which ſeemed alſo to have a neere alliance in beauty, ſhe deſired him to make her acquainted with the paſſages of his eſcape, ſince as ſhe ſaid, they could not but be admirable, conſidering the ſtrict guard the Senate was ever accuſtomed to ſet over the Kings children; in the interim <hi>Roxana</hi> curiouſly attended to underſtand the diſcourſe that was to proceed from ſuch dainty lips.</p>
            <p>Wherefore after <hi>Aſcanius</hi> had ſaluted his ſiſters looks, with three or foure gentle ſmiles, in which he ſeemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune and deride his Goalers careleſneſſe, he began this repetition, though firſt he excuſed himſelfe, for many circumſtances belonging to the ſtory.</p>
            <p>My father ſaid he, as he had commanded my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> for his better ſafety, into the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> there to attend the directions of our noble mother, ſo was he perſwaded by the <hi>Myſſians</hi> (in whoſe power he then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Army) to get me into his own poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the better to ſecure (as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) as many as might be of the bloud royall; To this purpoſe he commanded me to make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and preſently to repaire to his preſence; however with this caution, that if I ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the execution, I muſt not by any meanes reveale his deſire; leaſt the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſhould be brought into ſuſpition, who were then treating
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:169951:154"/>with the Senate about their payment.</p>
            <p>But be their pretences what they would, I ſtrengthened my duty and obedience, by all the thoughts my young yeares and leſſe diſcretion could ſuggeſt, advantageable to the deſigne and the Kings command, which I muſt tell you ſcarce gave ſleep to my eyes in the night, or reſt to my body in the day, ſince truly I muſt needs ſay, my youthfull ambition became more violent then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to doe ſomething exactly that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to care and wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the ſucceſſe proved unfortunate, I was to my intollerable griefe taken in my eſcape, though more perplexed I muſt confeſſe, to be foyled in my firſt interprize, then ſorrowfull at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the loſſe: being apprehended I was by order of the Senate, exactly examined before ſuch Commiſſioners, as their gravities ordained to be judges of my actions: However the gods ſo farre favoured my weake conſtancy, that neither tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor flattery, was able to ſhake my dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which ſo inraged their froward ſpleens, that they not only cauſed me to be ſhut up in a darke roome, but commanded ſome ſlight pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted upon my perſon, as a ſmall combatant in my fathers quarrell, at which I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laughed then ſeemed to feele: But not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe petty ſufferings could prevaile againſt my ſpirit, they ordered a great part of my dyet to be taken from me, as ſuppoſing belike my belly was eaſieſt to be conquered, when truly I never eſteemed meat the chiefe part of my conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169951:154"/>eſpecially when I was aſſured for their own ſakes, they would afford me ſufficient to ſuſtaine nature: yet at laſt having tryed all other wayes to compaſſe their ends, without receiving any fruit from their labours, they withdrew from me thoſe accuſtomed reſpects belonging to my birth and quality, which I cannot deny, but moſt wrought upon my diſpoſition; for that I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the dignity of my parents, as alſo your ſelfe ſweet ſiſter ſuffered in the omiſſion.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, finding themſelves wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the goodneſſe of my cauſe, rather then by my courage, they began of a ſudden to change (though not the theatre) yet the manner of their action; which was not only to ſweeten their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards me, but alſo to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of being their elected King. For as they ſaid, my father having totally abuſed his truſt, and my eldeſt brother <hi>Arethuſius</hi> being unkindly fled from their protection, they could finde none other ſo fit a perſon to undertake the government of the whole Kingdom as my ſelf, if I would but expreſſe love in my nature and be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their Counſels, for their intentions as they proteſted were never to deſtroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage to heare them to ſcandalize my fathers goodneſſe, &amp; go about to withdraw my duty by their intentions, I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that as my father had been much too gentle a Prince for ſuch people; ſo was their diſſimulation no more to be believed concerning my ſelfe in theſe offers, then when they proteſted to the world to make <hi>Euarchus</hi> the greateſt King of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169951:155"/>
               <hi>Aſia;</hi> And in the meane time had to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power deprived him of his Crowne and dignity.</p>
            <p>This blunt and reſolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a peviſh child, and could not be brought to underſtand my own good, they not only quitted my company, but by degrees ſuffered againe the ſtreame to returne into its right courſe, to my ſingular content; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever continued me ſtill a priſoner.</p>
            <p>Having paſt over ſo great a ſtorme without ſhipwrack either of my own honour, or danger to my fathers affaires, I began to conceive good opinions of my judgement, and beginning like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be extreame weary of my captivity, ſince my yeares now required activity, I fell into many conſiderations of another eſcape; and had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to put it in execution, not only by daily rumours I heard of the diſcontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of the Senate to agree with the King; but alſo, for that I underſtood many of the Kings ſhips had lately revolted from their ſervice: All which I ſay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed my thoughts to a new deſigne, and theſe inflamations of hope, deſire, and paſſion, made me diligent to procure the good opinion of thoſe that were intruſted with my perſon, as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence to my intention. I oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them to what end was it to uſe rigour in my impriſonment, when it might turn to their prejudice, if our ſide ſhould hereafter prevaile; neither could it at all benefit them for the preſent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169951:155"/>with their maſters by any rewards, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in authority?</p>
            <p>Theſe perſwaſions with other circumſtances, took them off from the fierceneſſe of their ſpeed, eſpecially when they had heard that <hi>Farezius</hi> was forced to ſend many of his Troops abroad, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Provinces againe to his obedience, that rather choſe to runne into deſperate dangers, then ſtill to continue under the Senates power.</p>
            <p>Theſe encouragements I ſay, made me beginne to frame thoſe <hi>Embryons</hi> I had already conceived in my unſetled braine to ſome ſhape, proper for production; and to this purpoſe, deſcending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a ſervant I have now brought along with me, (whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes found faithfull to my intentions) that my reſolution was, in this diſtracted ſeaſon to gaine my liberty out of the Caſtle; and therefore wiſht him to provide for my eſcape ſuch neceſſaries as were convenient for a buſineſſe of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that concerned not only my own ſafety, but my fathers proſperity, but in the interim to colour my deſigne, I gave it out that I intended to ſolemnize the birth day of my brother, by a publike Maske, to be acted for the delight of thoſe Souldiers of my guard: When the night came (having all the afternoon before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the expectation of the ſtory of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> flying from the ill natured rage of his cruell father) after they were all orderly placed in their ſeates, I cauſed the ſceane to be diſcovered, which appeared to their view of ſo taking a quality,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169951:156"/>that they had no leaſure at all to attend their charge, ſo that I had liberty ſufficient by their willing or careleſſe neglect, to paſſe divers times without my accuſtomed attendants, through the Galleries into my private bed chamber, as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I had ſome neceſſary office in the Play; but at laſt finding they were all either ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in their imployment of curioſity, or paſt conſideration by reaſon of their over liberall diet, I more ſecretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my ſervant to attend with womans apparell: which robes being ſoon fitted to my perſon, ſo well ſuited with my imagination, that I carried my ſelfe with much confidence amongſt the multitudes of company in every room, when I came into the common hall, my ſervant uſhered me as ſome Maſquer to the doore; where the Porter made no difficulty to give us paſſage, as believing it was a neceſſary duty belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in ſuch joviality, leaſt his fellowes might have derided him for his ridiculous caution.</p>
            <p>But however, I got thus proſperouſly from the danger of all the Courts of guard, yet the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell either bitten with his ſervile attendance in the open aire, whilſt his other companions in warme roomes enjoyed content, or being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more ſuſpitious then the reſt of his fellowes, began ſtrictly, not only to examine our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but roughly to deny our paſſage, in ſo much as my fervant not believing it was ſafe to admit of ſuch a hazardable contention, quickly drew out a ſhort hanger he had by his ſide, and gave
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169951:156"/>him a blow upon the pate, that made him aske counſell of the ground for the reſt of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, whether the wound was mortall or no, we left him only to conſider, whilſt we made our paſſage, free in the night ſeaſon, through a thick wood not farre diſtant from the Caſtle, untill the breaking of the morning, conſtrained us to ſeeke refuge in a darke cave, where we continued all the next day for feare of diſcovery, ſince we doubted not, but my flight would ſoon be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with open cry.</p>
            <p>When the skie began againe to be obſcured for our advantage after the going downe of the Sun, we thought it beſt to take a new journey towards the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where confuſion we ſuppoſed would ſecure us, untill we could finde a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient tranſportation for <hi>Syria;</hi> however our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, &amp; want of food compelled me the next day about noone, to take up my habitation in a ſmall Cottage under a hill ſide, in whoſe dwelling there only remained an old man with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one daughter, which by the way muſt occaſion a pretty ſhort ſtory: We no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the houſe, but being provoked by a ſufficient appetite, we called for ſuch proviſion as they had, promiſing a large payment, and they as willingly condiſcended to our deſires, in which office the maid ſeemed moſt diligent, not only in regard of her own good huſwifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as might be gathered by her ſmiling countenance at my ſtrange attire; in the houſe there was but two beds, the one where the old
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169951:157"/>people lay, and the other for the young wench; ſo that I was to take up my reſt neceſſarily in the Girles bed, where I muſt confeſſe, I ſlept to my content, whilſt my attendant made uſe of a bundle of ſtraw in an out houſe for his lodging: but in the morning I might feele, not only one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my breaſt, whom by more conſideration I found to be the young damoſell of the Cottage; This I muſt confeſſe put me to ſome confuſion, untill by a ſtrict examination of her intention, I perceived it was only her own innocent curioſity, becauſe ſhe thought me a fine young gentlewoman: At which relation the Princeſſe could not chuſe but laugh; the rather for that <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> did with ſomething a conſtrained earneſtneſſe, ſtrive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the wenches chaſtity, as if he had been jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous alſo of his own honour: yet nevertheleſſe he was forced to confeſſe, the Maid did much queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, becauſe he had no greater breaſts; But having ſufficiently cleared his reputation, and jeſted out the reſt, he againe continued his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>Although ſaid he, I had ſufficiently ſatisfied her in all queſtions concerning my travels, yet I had much adoe to perſwade her to riſe from me; ſo much was ſhe in love with my company, neither would ſhe condiſcend to my requeſt untill ſhe had againe imbraced me, beſtowing three or foure of her kiſſes upon my lips; This being performed, and having yawned a pretty ſpace, as a teſtimony of her youthfull lazineſſe, ſhe ſuddenly ſtarted out of the bed in her ſmock, that was not of the fineſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169951:157"/>cloath, where ſhe remained ſtill diſcourſing with me untill her father, and mother lying in the lower roome, gave her a call or two to haſten her ſpeed, yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not only the neereſt way to <hi>Sardis,</hi> but of the conveniency of the next Town, where I meant to provide my ſelfe of ſome change of apparrell, ſince I durſt not truſt thoſe, which brought me from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, after I had imployed my ſervant a few dayes neare the place to buy other Robes; and beſtowed my old apparrell upon the wench, for a gratuity of her kindneſſe, in affording me ſo freely her company the firſt night, I not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſecond I tooke my leave lovingly of the old people, who truly had entertained me with an honeſt Countrey affection, ſo that preſently according to our direction, we repaired to the Bankes of the River <hi>Pactolus,</hi> where we quickly hired a Barke, that without any ſuſpition at all brought us to <hi>Sardis,</hi> which Towne ſheltred us without diſcovery, untill we found another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to convey us to your Caſtle, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, we are confident you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your gueſts, but rather adviſe us by your Counſell, how to proſecute further my affaires; ſince it is to be thought, they will make a ſudden and diligent inquiry after my eſcape. At which words with a pretty ſmile the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> caſt her eyes upon her Governeſſe, as if ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from her experience the beſt direction for them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roxana,</hi> when ſhe had drawne the lookes of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169951:158"/>
               <hi>Aſcanius</hi> upon her in a curious manner, ſince he had not been formerly acquainted with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and alſo muſed according to her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome for ſome ſhort ſpace, ſhe gave this advice.</p>
            <p>Truly, ſaid ſhe, as it is moſt neceſſary in the prime place, that my Lord <hi>Aſcanius</hi> provide for his own ſecurity, ſince it is impoſſible but ſome ſpeedy ſearch will be after his eſcape, the Senate not being willing to part with ſo many of the Royall family out of their own juriſdiction; So Madam be pleaſed to thinke it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in <hi>Syria,</hi> may preſently be made acquainted with this fortunate delivery of my Lord your brother from his impriſonment by ſome truſty meſſenger to be diſpatched from our Counſels, which party may be (as I conceive) this faithfull ſervant, the companion of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, whom he hath now brought along with him into this Caſtle, who cannot well remaine here in that he will rather prove a Subject of ſuſpition then an officer of uſe, ſince the daily viſits of this place by the Nobility, and other people of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt of neceſſity bring his name in queſtion. And for this beautifull runaway your brother, ſince he ſo well becomes a Maids attire, and hath ſo bravely given teſtimony of his own modeſty, I ſee no reaſon why he may not ſtill live amongſt us, without danger to his own perſon, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our honours, being entertained as your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant in your chamber, untill either commands out of <hi>Syria</hi> call him away, or you your ſelfe be removed from the juriſdiction of this Kingdome, by your happy marriage with my Lord <hi>Narciſſus;</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:169951:158"/>at which words the Princeſſe became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young brother ſhould ſo abruptly have been made acquainted with her ſecret ingagement: But the fault was already committed, and <hi>Roxana</hi> had no time to aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, wherefore ſomething confounded by her errour, as well as ſhe could ſhe went on with her continued diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>However ſaid ſhe, that we may not remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of the proceedings of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, I ſhall induſtriouſly endeavour to inſtruct our little dwarfe, who wants no wit to make ſuch inquiry abroad, as may be moſt convenient for our affaires, for whoſe truth and honeſty I will undertake, with the engagement of my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This may give you a full liberty to enjoy with freedome each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am ſure, ſince the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your converſations; with theſe words ſhe reſted ſilent in a kinde of a grave ſmile, expecting the young couple ſhould ſigne their conſents by ſome demonſtration.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Roxana</hi> had fully ended her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the lovely paire looked upon each other, with ſuch a ſweet chearefulneſſe, as if their own paſſions had no deſire to enquire further after the depth of her reaſons, ſince their hearts abundantly approved of the conſequence of her deſigne, which was that they might enjoy the felicity of one anothers converſation; at laſt <hi>Cloria</hi> asked her brother, how he liked the wiſedome of her Governeſſe, which gave him occaſion to tell her,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169951:159"/>that he did not now wonder how ſhe had paſſed through the intricacie of ſo many dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, having had ſo faithfull and diſcreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vaſt ſea of ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accidents.</p>
            <p>In the meane time this delighted company paſt away their howers in ſuch converſation, as moſt tended to <hi>Euarchus</hi> wiſhed proſperity, ſometimes complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that could ſo long detaine their juſt and mercifull King in a darke priſon, inſtead of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at his feet humbly to deſire pardon for their offences, otherwhiles againe they would entertaine their thoughts, with new hopes of his releaſement by powerfull Armies ſent into <hi>Lydia</hi> by all the Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in which number <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> had no low ranke in the opinion of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall <hi>Cloria;</hi> neither ſeldome did they agree in beliefe, that the generall diſtractions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, would ſoon put an end to the differences without any other aſſiſtance, untill theſe diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fancies carried them one day into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where <hi>Clorias</hi> diligent ſervant in the view of other attendants, obſerved ſo carefully the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her charge; that ſhe made alwayes election of thoſe fruit that the Princeſſe intention did but only covet, and preſented them to be made more beautifull by the touch of her white hand.</p>
            <p>In theſe entertainments I ſay they continued untill an ancient Lord of the Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings poſterity, with a ſeeming joy that made him forget his accuſtomed ceremonies to the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169951:159"/>Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> not onely ſuddenly entred the Garden, but made a kind of rude paſſage through the crowd of ſuch as waited neere her perſon; and with a breathleſſe voyce informed her, that, that very morning, as the Nobility were ſitting in their own Councell chamber, divided by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the common aſſembly of the lower Senate, they were ſaluted in a tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by may thouſands of people (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a petition, that not onely complained of the proceedings of the Army, but defired they might again ſpeedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedome of the Lawes, and an eſtabliſhment of their Religion, as they ſaid abſolutely obſtructed from their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, by the licentious power of the Souldiers under <hi>Farezius</hi> command, whom (as they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) they had formerly choſen to be their Captaine for ſome ſeaſon, but not to be a tyrant againſt their priviledges for ever; vowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that as they would not depart the great City of <hi>Sardis</hi> without a direct anſwer, ſo were they reſolved to procure an accompliſhment of their juſt requeſts, to the hazzard of their lives, and fortunes.</p>
            <p>O Madam, ſaid he, how theſe brave begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, inflamed our ſoules with new courages: notwithſtanding, we could not chuſe in ſome ſort, but reflect upon our own poorneſſe of ſpirit, or at leaſtwiſe dulneſſe in underſtanding, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about to put in execution what theſe people propound at preſent for their and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <pb n="314" facs="tcp:169951:160"/>
            <p>Truely, replied the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> although I cannot but commend theſe peoples underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that appeare to have ſome ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their reputations yet muſt I a great deale more extoll their courages, that dare expoſe themſelves to maintaine thoſe ſmall priviledges, which by a certaine kind of birth-right they have received from their honeſt and wiſe ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; when as you of the Nobility, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſeem altogether ſtupid in the apprehenſion of ſuch honourable rights that appertain to your qualities, left you by the brave endeavour of your moſt Noble predeceſſors: who were at the firſt ſo ſpleenative indiſcreet, in your paſſions againſt your Prince (though without any known cauſe whatſoever) that you were content to ſacrifice your known own advantages, above the common all people, onely that you might but deſtroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your ſelves ſo much power as to be able again to recover your own dignities.</p>
            <p>Theſe words and reproofe of the Princeſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt put the Nobleman out of his tale; but ſhe finding him ſomething out of countenance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to the proſecution of his relation:</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition (as we termed it) what our own duties ſhould have remembred, we preſently diſmiſſed them, with other ſpeeches and promiſes, that ſufficiently contented them for the inſtant. After they were gone, I muſt tell you, we were ſent to the other part of the Senate, ſitting in another room diſtinct from ours; intimating
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169951:160"/>we deſired ſome conference with them, whereby the people might be rendred ſatisfied in their ſeeming juſt demands: upon our meeting, many things were propounded to that purpoſe, as well concerning our ſelves as the ſouldiers; but what will be the iſſue of theſe proceedings, for my part I am not able to divine: onely we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> untill they have received ſuch anſwer, as may in ſome ſort give content to their thoughts: which either muſt ſettle the Kingdom in a probable poſture for peace and quietneſſe, or ſo inflame the Armies reſolutions, that they will endeavour to become maſters of the whole. With theſe words he abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehenſions had been tranſported only by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary conceipts.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as the Lord had quitted the garden, and the reſt of the attendance being alſo removed ſome diſtance from them, the Princeſſe, <hi>Aſcanius</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> began to fall upon confiderations and diſcourſes of the Kings affaires: ſometimes their hopes were carried to aſſure themſelves, that it was unpoſſible, but thoſe confuſions muſt needs produce effects to that purpoſe; ſince, as they believed, the ſouldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and then the common peoples deſires of neceſſity would again bring him into his Throne: for they imagined, that however there might be obſtacles &amp; contentions for the preſent, in regard of the extraordinary power of the army, yet the ſouldiers at the laſt could not but admit of a King, more willingly then any other
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:169951:161"/>Generall of their own ranke to command over them: beſides they doubted not, but the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> would joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eſtabliſh <hi>Euarchus</hi> in the ſame honour and dignity as he was in before theſe late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; ſince the conſequences had already not a little impoveriſhed the whole Kingdom, and what it would doe further if it ſhould continue, might very well be feared, though as yet not certainly known; In that the dignity of a Court probably, would as well confirme the one in their heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary priviledges, as inrich the others by traffique and commerce; ſeeing it was chiefly the better ſort of perſons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants.</p>
            <p>Theſe pleaſant apprehenſions invited them all three to take ſome delight, in a certaine beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and refreſhing Grote, encompaſſed round about by an intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderneſs of flouriſhing Trees, that ſhaded it ſufficiently from the eyes of people: in the middeſt thereof there was a Fountaine upon the borders, in which was contrived many ſorts of Chaces by dogges and huntſmen; who by the turning of ſeverall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Cocks, ſeemed not onely to move in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their prey, but the hounds with open mouthes barked and made a noyſe. The pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the conceit, for a long ſpace gave young <hi>Aſcanius</hi> ſufficient content: when they were weary of beholding of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities. There they might behold <hi>Andromeda,</hi> with the Sea Monſter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the water to devoure her, whilſt her
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169951:161"/>ſorrowfull parents ſtood upon the bordering ſhore, to behold that wofull and lamenable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, occaſioned as they thought by the too much ſeverity and cruelty of the gods, untill <hi>Perſeus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dane,</hi> that was courted in a ſhower of Gold by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> deſcended from the skies upon his flying horſe, and ſeemed to reſcue the diſtreſſed Lady. There were alſo to be ſeen in that place, divers Artificers, working in their Trades, onely by the force and current of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in like manner, others playing upon ſeverall kinds of Inſtruments, both delightfull to the eare, and pleaſing to the apprehenſion. Beſides, Birds of all ſpecies, made of Glaſſe and other materials, that ſeemed to chirpe in a naturall way, though onely ſo contrived by the meere invention of men, to give the greater ſatisfaction to luxurious ſenſe. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with theſe delightfull vanities, the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> being better skil'd then her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the uſe of ſuch devices, ſuddenly turned one of the pipes, which quickly over-ſpread young <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> with a large Canopy of Water, that reſembled a plentifull, though ſweet ſhower from the heavens, in ſo much as he knew not at the inſtant, how to winde himſelfe out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, untill he was forced to entreat his ſiſters favour for his redemption; neither did ſhe altogether afford him that grace, ſince he became a little wet to purchaſe a convenient experience againſt another time. But <hi>Roxana,</hi> as if ſhe thought her Miſtreſſe had uſed ſomething too much ſeverity towards her young brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:169951:162"/>a needleſſe apologie for the action, when ſhe might have known <hi>Aſcanius</hi> could not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at any thing his ſiſter did. When they had as it were dwelt long enough upon theſe watry pleaſures, they again returned into their own lodgings, in which place the metamorpoſed mayd was moſt carefull to obſerve thoſe decorums that belonged to her office, and attendance, leaſt the contrary might have occaſioned the endangering of his diſcovery: where they remained, I may ſay, entertaining themſelves ſometimes with hopes, and ſometimes with feares, untill the dwarfes returne brought them more certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, of many paſſages both from <hi>Sardis</hi> and other Regions: however becauſe they deſired to underſtand his information, in the moſt metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall way, in regard the circumſtances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions on foot, they wiſht him to tell his ſtory and adventures in order, which he performed in this manner.</p>
            <p>After ſaid he, I parted from this Caſtle, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your command I went to the very doore of the Senate-houſe, the beſt place as I thought for intelligence; where finding all thoſe that ſtood without in a moſt confuſed diſtraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the chiefe Senators, of a ſudden came out of the room; when preſently they went with a great deale of haſte towards another chamber, where I underſtood by the diſcourſes of the multitude, they were deſigned to meet ſome of the Lords about a conference, concerning the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:169951:162"/>ſettlements of the diſorders of the Kingdome. I being both bold, and little, and ſo conſequently as I thought not much to be ſuſpected, in the confuſed crowd thruſt in along with them, where placing my ſelfe in a nook of the chamber under a hanging it was my chance to heare theſe ſeverall diſcourſes from them.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of Senators that ſpake, thought it convenient, if not altogether neceſſary, again to ſettle the King in his ancient dignity, not onely in regard of the extraordinary cries of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to that purpoſe, but alſo for that there were ſo many ſeverall factions within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Senate, not probable to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with any advantage to the Nation: Others notwithſtanding were of a contrary opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that it were better to hazard the ruine of the whole Countrey in a generall confuſion, then to come any more under the juriſdiction of that Tyrannicall government, as they ſaid they had with ſo much bloud already endeavoured to deſtroy: A third number of that aſſembly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſome ſort to be willing to reſtore againe <hi>Euarchus</hi> to his Crowne in full luſtre, but they doubted, leaſt his unrelenting ſpleen might put him on, to call the Senate to a ſtrict account for their paſt actions, and ſeverity uſed both againſt his authority and perſon; wherefore wiſht rather to have ſome of his poſterity Crowned in his place, whom for ſuch a benefit as they believed, would eaſily be perſwaded to forgive and forget his fathers injuries: This propoſition a long time entertained their fancies, untill they conſidered,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:169951:163"/>that not only Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> was in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Syria,</hi> proſecuting the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſignes, and my Lord <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his brother had lately by flight procured his owne liberty without their conſents, that abſolutely beate back any more diſcourſe upon that ſubject; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought it convenient, if not extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for the preſent, to give what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they could to the diſcontented people, who belike attended in great numbers, about the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> to that purpoſe: yet it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all, that if they ſhould endeavour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to pleaſe the multitude, without having their Swords ready drawne in their hands, whereby to be able to chaſtize them, if they ſhould prove too unreaſonable in their demands, they muſt expect dangerous and inſolent affronts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of quietneſſe and obedience to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: In ſo much as they thought it convenient in the interim that they entertained the peoples expectations, with good words and faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to ſend privately to <hi>Farezius,</hi> wiſhing him to be ready to march with his Souldiers, to keep the multitude in due obedience to the Senates autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity if they ſhould continue theſe extravagant proſecutions of their deſignes, which in effect being fully reſolved upon by them all, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broake up the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>So that when they were in this manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and I had freed my ſelfe undiſcovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gaine what other intelligence I could amongſt the common people, ſince I conceived, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169951:163"/>in their conſtant and brave reſolutions, to which purpoſe they ſeemed in ſome ſort to have aſſembled themſelves, with an intention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt the preſent government, by ſome violent manner of proſecution, though for the better colour of their actions and intentions, they appeared only with petitions in their hands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of other weapons of danger: With theſe thoughts I held it my beſt courſe to retire into the very heart or body of the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> as well to feele the pulſe and conſtitution of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as the likelier to be informed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, concerning all other proceedings of the Kingdome: neither in this deſigne was I much deceived in my expectation, for ſorting my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with watermen and other inferiour people, I underſtood, that as the rich Citizens of the Towne, although they deſire againe to have their King to governe over them, though with ſome reſtriction in his power, becauſe they feare his revenge, ſince otherwiſe as they believe, they could probably expect nothing but a generall confuſion, ſo of the other ſide it is apparant the multitude for the moſt part deſire a change; not only in regard of the envy they beare to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who more abſolutely command over their perſons and eſtates then the King ever did in his greateſt glory, but alſo in regard, they doubt the Souldiers at the laſt, will come to be Maſters of every mans fortune; which juriſidction of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they moſt deteſt in their natures and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitions: As I was ſufficiently ſatisfied in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the people, I repaired to the publike
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169951:164"/>place of commerce for the whole City, where (in ſhort) amongſt the Merchants I underſtood, that not onely a great part of the Navy was revolted to the King (the Marriners being encouraged thereunto by ſome Senators which <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> the Generall had formerly ſent into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but that the <hi>Myſſians</hi> were alſo preparing a great Army, by the directions of the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſuddenly to invade <hi>Lydia,</hi> on the Kings behalfe. Theſe newes giving my endeavours ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient encouragement, ſtill to proſecute my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, for other intelligences, within three or foure daies afterward, I became certainly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the Senate being not able, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not willing to give the multitude ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the deſire of their petitions, they had in great numbers not onely taken up armes for their own defence, in regard they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Farezius</hi> had directions, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the oppoſition of the Lords, to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their aſſemblies with all his power, but they had alſo ſeized upon many Caſtles and Towns, towards their enterprize and aſſiſtance in the Kings name; with whom in like manner many of the Nobility joyn with conſiderable Forces. Laſt of all, you may be pleaſed to know, That <hi>Hercrombrotus,</hi> Lieutenant Generall to <hi>Farezius,</hi> is of a ſudden called away with a great part of the Army, towards the confines of <hi>Lydia,</hi> neere the City of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> occaſioned by reaſon of the revolt of ſome of his own Commanders, who are joyned with the power and force of the Countrey to oppoſe the Senates proceeding:
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169951:164"/>which in effect is the full information I can give concerning my imployment.</p>
            <p>When the Dwarfe had made an end of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſmiled upon her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely to ſee how well the boy had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his office, according to the confidence her Governeſſe <hi>Roxana</hi> had in his wit and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but withall in regard of the inward joy ſhe felt concerning the King her fathers affaires, that ſeemed now to be in a better poſture then they were, almoſt ſince the beginning of his troubles: for ſhe imagined by the conſequences, his ſubjects would be conſtrained for their own advantages, to place him again in his Throne, in a higher ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of power then before. <hi>Aſcanius</hi> of the other ſide, expreſſed alſo by his countenance the like gladneſſe, in ſo much as after a little ſpace, as if he had been in a manner tranſported with thoughts of delight and ſatisfaction, according to his youthfull conceptions, that were apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entertaine all Ideas of content and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, preſently runne to his ſiſter, and whilſt both his arms were caſt about her neck, he ſealed, as well his affection as his joy upon her Ruby lips, by a multitude of ſweet though more deere kiſſes: but ſhe at laſt, either ſomething apprehending the too much importunity of ſuch affections, or elſe deſirous to inform her ſelfe better of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, told her brother in a jeſting way, that as ſhe could ſcarce diſpence with the rigid rules of her own modeſty, to have her virgin lips ſo aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although it were from an affectionate bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe innocent vertue was beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:169951:165"/>of ſcandall, ſo did ſhe of the other fide exceedingly wonder, that his own change of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which onely procured his ſafety, under the protection of the Caſtle, where for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they remained, had not wrought in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, ſince now he was to eſteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather a ſervant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: not a Prince, replyed <hi>Aſcanius?</hi> the gods defend, I ſhould ever harbour in my breſt ſuch poore and unworthy thoughts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the injuſtice or malice of any fortune whatſoever: no ſiſter, be you aſſured, that both for your ſake and my own, I ſhall alwaies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by my actions, to ſhew that I am ſonne to <hi>Euarchus</hi> and <hi>Hyacinthia,</hi> and I doubt not but you will doe the like concerning your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: But yet, replied the ſweet Princeſſe, we are obliged in ſome ſort to yield to our fates, when we have not means ſufficient left us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kind of a tyrannicall power granted them by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (perhaps onely in correction of our offences) doe impriſon and circumſcribe our perſons, what matters of conſequence can our mindes afford us to our advantage in ſuch exigencies? O ſay not ſo, anſwered <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> for the mind is able to be a noble conquerour over all unfortunate diſaſters; ſince in my youthfull ſtudies I have read of many brave perſons, that in the higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tyranny, and afflictions impoſed upon their bodies, by their worſt and greateſt enemies, have at laſt in deſpight of all their cruelty, born
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:169951:165"/>away the onely palme and Lawrell of victory; as it were confounding their very perſecutors, with the extraordinary conſtancy of their own ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Theſe, ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I muſt confeſſe are brave reſolutions in words, if they can be as well practiſed by actions: for I muſt tell you, that fleſh and bloud cannot eaſily put off all naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; though I will not deny, but the ſoule may doe miracles, being ayded by divine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; and oftentimes hath demonſtrated wonderfull effects, meerely out of ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſenſe, or inflammation of honour, both by Souldiers and Philoſophers. Truly, ſaid <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,</hi> then it were very hard, being Kings chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if we ſhould not in our proceedings meet with ſome of theſe faculties to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible ſlaves in former ages have aboundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, ſuch heroicall ſuffering.</p>
            <p>As they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had for a long ſpace kept a moſt formall and grave ſilence, thought it alſo convenient to ſhew her own wiſdome; the rather, ſince her yeeres and experience, pretended to a certaine kind of prerogative amongſt thoſe of the younger ſort of people. Truely, ſaid ſhe, as I cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a ſingular benefit to many ſorts of people, in their preſſing and difficult occaſions; yet when with a wiſe (though not a baſe) complyance, we can avoyd both the inconvenience and hazard to our ſelves, with more eaſe and no diſhonour, I ſee no reaſon, why we ſhould goe about to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:169951:166"/>ſtraine nature to no purpoſe? eſpecially if we be not well aſſured to gaine a beneficiall victory by the contention; And if we faile in that we ſeem to undertake, we contract thereby a further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and diſreputation to our ſelves, then if we had not at all offered to contend againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and oppreſſion at the firſt: beſides oftentimes thoſe reſiſtances in the dark ſhall never come tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the knowledge of the world, ſo that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we faile then of that glory, our fooliſh and prepoſterous ambition aymed at by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions: by which means we ſhall be rather enterpreted to be blown up with vain-glorious fumes, then ſeaſoned with true fortitude: In time the beſt mixture muſt be ſo to moderate our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that as precipitately we put not our ſelves upon vain and needleſſe ſufferings, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo ought not we too much to yield to the inconſtant ſtroakes of fortune and oppreſſion, when either honour or religion calls us to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique demonſtration of our bravery and courage. But however theſe diſputations might either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>Cloria,</hi> or convert her brother, yet <hi>Aſcanius</hi> finding the opportunity, for his own deſired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the Kings affaires, he reſolved as ſoon as poſſible he could, to ſeek occaſion for his own ſpeedy departure; which did not a little afflict the conſiderations of his ſweet ſiſter the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> who began to contract a moſt ſingular delight in the witty converſation of her deare brother. Nevertheleſſe ſhe reſolved not to be ſo great a friend to her own paſſions, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby an enemy to his honour, and her
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169951:166"/>fathers proſperity: ſo that this being after ſome conſultation determined on all ſides, <hi>Aſcanius</hi> intended in ſome new diſguiſe, like a boy belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Navy, to ſteale privately away to ſea, under the protection of thoſe officers that might afford him the conveniency, to repaire to thoſe ſhips that had revolted from the Senates ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</p>
